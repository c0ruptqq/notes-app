If dissipative forces are present the motion is *damped*. There are three damping types:  * Light damping - When the time period is independent of the amplitude so each cycle takes the same length of time as the oscillations die away. * Critical damping - Just enough to stop the system oscillating after it had been displaced. The system returns to the equilibrium in the shortest possible time without overshooting if set up correctly (eg. car suspension). * Heavy damping - When the damping is so strong that the displaced object returns to equilibrium much more slowly than is the system is critically damped (eg. spring system in thick oil).  !\\[\\[img/phys/damping.png.png]] "},{"route":"content/physics/year1/Index","title":"Index","content":"* Capacitance * Circular Motion * Electricity * Materials * Measurement * Mechanics * Optics * Particle * Quantum * SHM * Wave Mechanics "},{"route":"content/physics/year1/Capacitance","title":"Capacitance","content":"# Intro  A capacitor stores charge.

As processes within the atom occur, electrons are able to transition between energy levels depending on their energies. n=1 is the lowest possible energy an electron can have - the ground state energy.  ![34.png](/img/phys/34.png)  The energies are negative, as the electrons \"owe\" the atom energy to leave the atom.  ## Ionisation  Energy levels can be used to understand ionisation. high energy electron colliding with an atom can cause the ejection of an inner shell electron from an atom causing what is called ionisation. If $n = \\infty$ it is ionised. $\\therefore$ $n=1 -> n=\\infty$ is ionisation energy. Once the electron leaves the atom it has positive energy in the form Kinetic Energy.  ## Excitation  Colliding electrons which have a lower energy than the ionisation energy can still cause the atom to absorb their energy without ionisation occurring. This causes the electrons to transition from a lower Energy Level to a higher one - called excitation. Random perturbations in vacuum often cause electrons to fall back down to a lower energy level, causing a photon to be released. The energy of the photon is the same as the change in energy of the Energy levels.  $\\lambda = \\frac {hc} {E}$ "},{"route":"content/physics/year 1/Projectile","title":"Projectile Motion","content":"* Objects move in two dimensions (Vertically and horizontally) * Combination of linear motion and free fall  As mentioned in [suvat](physics/year%201/Suvat.md) there are a few formulas that can be useful, mainly the following will be used.  $$ s = ut+ \\frac 1 2 at^2 $$  ### Example of show a problem could be laid out  If we concider a ball on top of a one meter cliff height 1m which if given the constant velocity of $4ms^{-1}$ the follwing diagram could be drawn:  ![problem](/img/phys/20.jpeg)  To find the distance traveled (S) and time taken to travel that distance we can seperate the ball's motion into horizontal and vertical:  | Horizontal      | Vertical        | | --------------- | --------------- | | s: ?            | s:1             | | u: $4ms^{-}$    | u:0             | | a:0             | a: $-9.81ms^2$  | | t               | t               |  Where \"t\" is the same for both.  $\\therefore$ Time can be calculated using the formula above and the values in the \"Vertical\" column $$ s = ut + \\frac 1 2 at^2 $$ $$ 1 = \\frac 1 2(-9.81)t^2 $$ $$ t = \\sqrt {\\frac 1 {4.905}} = 0.45s $$  The sign in the above solutions changes to \"+\" under the root as time cannot be negative.

Below are I/V graph of three components: ![graphs](/img/phys/15.png)  In a bulb the gradient (resistance R) increases as bulb heats up. As it heats up, atoms vibrate with greater KE, thus electrons collided with them with increasing frequency, thus flow decreases and R increases.

A parametric graph is one in which x and y, instead of being directly linked in a Cartesian equation (like $y = x^2$) are instead both linked to another variable (called a parameter). For example, $y = t^2$, $x = 3t$ is a parametric graph going through (0, 0), (1, 3), (4, 6) etc (each value of t gives an (x, y) point). It is usually possible to find a Cartesian equation for a graph from its parametric equations by eliminating the parameter.  #### Example 8.1  Find a Cartesian equation for the parametric curve $x=5t$, $y=3t^2$ $(0\\<t<20)$, stating its domain  #### Solution 8.1  $$ x = 5t => t= \\frac x 5 $$  $$ \\begin {aligned} \\therefore y &=3(\\frac x 5)^2 \\text{ for } 0< \\frac x 5 < 20 \\ & = \\frac {3x^2} {25} \\text{ for } 0\\<x<100 \\end{aligned} $$  For parametric equations involving trig functions, if you can't find a simple way to link x and y, use an appropriate trig identity.  #### Example 8.2  Find the Cartesian equation of the curve $x=\\sin t + 2$, $y=\\cos t -3$  #### Solution 8.2  $$ x=\\sin t => \\sin t = x-2 $$  $$ y = \\cos t -3 => \\cos t =y+3 $$  $$ \\therefore \\cos^2 t\\sin^2 t = 1 => (x-2)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 1 $$  ## 8.2 Working with Parametric Equations  #### Example 8.3  The diagram shows a curve C with parametric equations $x = at^2 + t$, $y = a(t^3 +8)$,  where $a$ is a non-zero constant. Given that C passes through the point (–4, 0), a) find the value of a, b) find the coordinates of the points A and B where the curve crosses the y-axis. ![img/math/book-2/9.png](/img/math/book-2/10.png)  #### Solution 8.3  a) (-4,0) on C =>  $\\begin{aligned} &1) -4=at^2 + t \\ &2) 0 = a(t^3+8) \\ \\&t^3 + 8=0 \\ & t = -2\\end{aligned}$  $\\therefore 1) -4=a(-2)^2 -2$  $\\therefore a= -\\frac {1} {2}$  b) @ A and B $x=0$  $$ \\therefore - \\frac {1} {2} t^2 + t=0 $$ $$ t(- \\frac {1}{2}t+1)=0 $$ $$ @t=0 \\text{ } y=- \\frac {1}{2}(8)=-4 $$  $$ @t=2 \\text{ } y=- \\frac {1}{2}(16)=-8 $$  $$ \\therefore A=(0,4) \\text{ } B=(0,-8) $$  #### Example 8.4  A curve is given parametrically by the equations $x=t^2$, $y=4t$. The line $x+y+4=0$ meets the curve at A. Find the coordinates of A.  #### Solution 8.4  $$ \\begin{aligned}x=t^2 \\ y=4t \\x+y+4=0 \\ t^2+4t+4=0 \\ t=-2 \\ \\therefore @t=-2 \\text{ } & x=4 \\ \\&y=-8 \\ \\therefore A=(4,-8)\\end{aligned} $$  ## 8.3 Finding Areas under Parametric Curves  We know that the area under a graph (bounded by $x = a$ and $x = b$) is given by $\\int^b\\_aydx$.

Therefore ${U\\_n}$ is arithmetic if and only if $U\\_{n+1} -U\\_n = d$ for all positive integers $n$ where $d$ is a constants number (known as the common difference). To find any term of an arithmetic sequence all we need to know is the term number and the common difference.  So $U\\_1$ is the first term (given the letter $a$)  then the second term $U\\_2 = U\\_1 +d$, $U\\_3 = U\\_1 + 2d$ and so on. Therefore the general term $U\\_n = a + (n-1)d$.  ## 3.2 Arithmetic Series  A *series* is formed by adding together the terms in a sequence (so the series $S\\_n$ is defined to be the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence; in other words $S\\_n = u\\_1 + u\\_2 + ... + u\\_n$). The sum of a series is the result when all the terms in the series have been added. An arithmetic series is a series based on an arithmetic sequence. Therefore for an arithmetic series:  $$ \\begin{aligned} S\\_n & = u\\_1 + u\\_2 + ... + u\\_n \\ & = a + (a+d) + (a+2d)+...+(a+(n-2)d)+(a+(n-1)d)(\\*) \\end{aligned} $$  Writing this in reverse we have:  $$ S\\_n = (a+(n-1)d) + (a + (n-2)d)+ ...+(a+2d)+(a+d)+a (+) $$  Adding (\\*) and (+) gives:  $$ \\begin{aligned} 2S\\_n &= 2a + (n-1)d + 2a + (n-1)d +...+2a+(n-1)d + 2a + (n-1)d \\text{\\[n times]} \\ & = n(2a+ (n-1)d)  \\end{aligned} $$  $$ \\therefore S\\_n=\\frac n 2(2a+(n-1)d) \\text{ or else, equivalently, }S\\_n= \\frac n 2 (a+l) \\text{ , where l is the last term being summed} $$  ## 3.3 Geometric Sequences  A *geometric sequence* is one where every term is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero constant. Therefore ${U\\_n}$ is geometric if and only if $\\frac {U\\_n+1} {U\\_n} = r$, for all positive integers $n$, where $r$ is a constant number (known as the *common ratio*). To find any term of a geometric sequence, All we need to know is the first term and the common ratio. So if *a* is the first term of our sequence then $u\\_2 = ar$. Therefore, the general term is given by $u\\_n = u\\_1\\*r^{n-1}$.  ## 3.4 Geometric Series  A *geometric series* is based on a geometric sequence. Therefore, for a geometric series,  $$ \\begin{aligned}S\\_n & = u\\_1 + u\\_2 + ...+ u\\_n \\ & = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + r^{n-1} \\end{aligned} $$  $$ \\therefore rS\\_n = ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^n $$  $$ \\therefore rS\\_n -S\\_n = ar^n-a=a(r^n-1) $$  $$ \\therefore S\\_n = \\frac {a(r^n-1)} {r-1} $$  or, equivalently,  $$ S\\_n = \\frac {a(1-r^n)} {1-r} $$  for $r \\neq 1$  ## 3.5 Sum to Infinity  If $-1 < r <1$ then when $n$ is very large $r^n \\approx 0$ so $S\\_n$ will get closer and closer to $\\frac a {1-r}$. We say that the series *converges* and has a sum to infinity ($S\\_{\\infty}$)of $\\frac a {1-a}$.  ## 3.6 Sigma Notation  To save time, sums can be written using sigma ($\\Sigma$) notation.  $$ \\sum\\_{r=a}^{b} f(r) $$  means add up all the terms you get from putting $r=a$ into a fraction and then $r=a+1$ in and so on until you get to $r=b$  ## 3.6 Recurrence Relations  Rather than giving a direct formula for $u\\_n$ , an alternative approach is to use *recurrence relations* where each term is defined in terms of the previous term (or terms). To be able to define a sequence in this way we also need to be told the first term (or terms).

For example, $|5| = |-5| = 5$ A modulus function ($y=|f(x)|$) is defined as $|f(x)| = f(x)$ for $f(x) \\geq 0$ and $|f(x)| = -f(x)$ for $f(x) \\leq 0$.  ![img/math/book-2/1.jpg](/img/math/book-2/1.jpg)  ## 2.2 Graph Transformations  ![img/phys/book-2/2.jpeg](/img/math/book-2/2.jpeg)  ## 2.3 Solving Equations and Inequalities Involving Modulus  When asked to solve an equation (and even more so with inequalities) that involves the modulus function, the best thing to do is draw a sketch and have a look at the number of solutions and where they occur.  #### Example 2.2  Solve:  $$ |4x|=|3x+2| $$  #### Solution 2.2  ![3.jpeg](/img/math/book-2/3.jpeg)  ## 2.4 Functions and Mappings  A *mapping* is something that transforms one set of numbers into another. We call the initial set the *domain* and the resulting set the *range*. For example: ![img/math/book-2/4.jpeg](/img/math/book-2/4.jpeg)  A *function* is a specific type of mapping where every element in the domain goes to exactly one element in the range. This means that mappings are only functions if ther are one-to-one or many-to-one. For example, $\\frac 1 x$ isn't a function iof 0 is in the domain (since 0 wouldn't be mapped to anything). Similarly, $\\pm \\sqrt{x}$ isn't a function even if we restrict the domain to positive numbers) since every element of the domain would be mapped to two things in the range (eg. $16 -> \\pm 4$). Note that this means that whether something is or isn't a function can depend as much on the domain as it does on the algebraic rule being applied. This means that it is crucial that the domain of a function is specified as part of its definition. Note that if we graph a mapping we can see quickly whether it is a function; any vertical line must hit the graph exactly once for each x-value in the domain for the mapping to be a function.  #### Example 2.3  For each of the following mappings, state whether the mapping is one-to-one, many-to-one or one-to-many and state whether it represents a function. ![img/math/book-2/5.jpeg](/img/math/book-2/5.jpeg)  #### Solution 2.3  * a) One-to-many * b) One-to-one; is a function * c) If 0 is excluded its a function * d) Many-to-one; is a function  ## 2.5 Composite Functions  We can combine functions to make new ones called *composite functions*. If $f$ and $g$ are two functions then $fg(x)$ (or $f \\* g(x)$) means to do $g$ to $x$ and then do $f$.  #### Example 2.5  Let $f(x) = 2x+1$ and $g(x)=x^2-4$ find $fg(x)$  #### Solution 2.5  $$ \\begin{aligned} fg(x) & = f(x^2-4) \\ &= 2(x^2-4) +1 \\ &= 2x^2 -8 +1\\\\&= 2x^2-7 \\end{aligned} $$  ## Inverse Functions  The inverse function of $f$ (called $f^{-1}$) 'undoes' the function so doing $f$ and $f^{-1}$ to something is the equivalent of not doing anything. Note that:  1. Only one-to-one functions have inverse functions (since if a function is many-to-one the inverse mapping will be one-to-many so won't be a function) 2. The graph of $y = f^{-1}(x)$ is a reflection of the graph of $y = f(x)$  in the line $y = x$ 3. The domain of $f$ if the range of $f^{-1}$ 4. The range of $f$ if the domain of $f^{-1}$  This first point means that for many-to-one functions we sometimes need to restrict the domain of the function before we are able to find the inverse (eg. $f(x) = x^2$ has no inverse for the domain $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ but does for the domain $x \\geq 0$. The last two points mean that we can answer questions about the domain and range of an inverse function without ever needing to work out what the definition of the inverse function is.

Find $|\\vec{AB}|$ and find the minimum value that $|\\vec{AB}|$ can be.  #### Solution 12.1  $$ \\begin{aligned}\\vec{AB}&=\\vec{OB}-\\vec{OA} \\ &=\\begin{pmatrix}2t \\ t\\ 3\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}t \\ 5 \\t-1\\end{pmatrix} \\ & = \\begin{pmatrix}t \\ t-5 \\ 4-t\\end{pmatrix}\\end{aligned} $$  $$ \\begin{aligned}\\therefore |\\vec{AB}| &= \\sqrt{ t^{2}+(t-5)^{2}+(4-t)^{2}}\\\\&=\\sqrt{ 3t^{2}-18t+41 }\\ \\therefore d^{2}&=3t^{2}-18t+41 \\ \\frac{d(d^{2})}{dt} &= 6t-18 \\ \\text{@ min } \\frac{d(d^{2})}{dt} &= 0 \\implies t=3 \\ \\therefore \\text{ min }|\\vec{AB}| &= \\sqrt{ 3(3)^{2}-18(3)+41 } \\ &=\\sqrt{ 14 } \\end{aligned} $$  ## 12.3 Geometric Problem Solving  In 2D, if vectors a and b are non-parallel then you can compare their coefficients on both sides of an equation. For example, if $3a + 4b = xa + yb$ then $x = 3$ and $y = 4$. In 3D the equivalent idea says that if vectors a, b and c are not co-planar (ie. don’t all lie in the same plane) then you can compare their coefficients on both sides of an equation. For example, $3a + 4b – 5c = xa + yb + zc$ then $x = 3$, $y = 4$ and $z = –5$.  #### Example 12.2  ![/img/Pasted image 20240506181519.png](img/math/book-2/22.png)  #### Solution 12.2  If OE and BG intersect then call the point of intersection X.

For example, to write $\\frac {6x^2 + 5x -2} {x(x-1)(2x+1)}$ as partial fractions we set it equal to $\\frac A x + \\frac B {x-1} + \\frac C {2x+1}$ and proceed the same way. However we need to be careful when we have repeated factors in the denominator.  #### Example 1.4  Write the following as partial fractions:  $$ \\frac {11x^2 + 14x +5} {(x+1)^2(2x+1)} $$  #### Solution 1.4  $$ \\frac {11x^2 + 14x +5} {(x+1)^2(2x+1)} = \\frac A {(x+1)^2} + \\frac B {(x+1)} + \\frac C {(2x+2)} $$  Where $A(2x+1) + B(x+1)(2x+1) + C(x+1)^2 = 11x^2 + 14x + 15$  $$ x = -1 => A = -2 $$  $$ x = -\\frac 1 2 => C = 3 $$  Compare coefficients: $$ 2B + C = 1 $$  $$ 2B = 8 $$  $$ B = 4 $$  If we start off with an improper fraction, we can use division of polynomials (divide the top line by the bottom) to turn it into a polynomial + partial fractions.  #### Example 1.5  Express the following as an improper fraction  $$ \\frac {4x^2 -5x -3} {(x-2)(x+1)} $$  #### Solution 1.5  $$ \\frac {4x^2 -5x -3} {(x-2)(x+1)}= \\frac {4(x^2 -x -2) -x + 5} { x^2 -x -2}= 4 + \\frac {5-x} {(x-2)(x+1)} $$  And from there it can be solved by the methods outlined above.  ## 1.3 Proof by contradiction  To prove something by contradiction, we start by making the assumption that it is NOT true. We then proceed logically from this assumption to look to get to something that doesn't make sense, telling us that what we assumed was wrong and so the statement must in fact be true.  #### Example 1.6  Prove that if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even.  #### Solution 1.6  Assumption: There exists a number n such that $n^2$ is even but $n$ is odd. $n$ is odd so $n=2k+1$ $\\therefore n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k +1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) +1$ So $n^2$ is odd. This contradicts the assumption that $n^2$ is even. Therefore, if $n^2$ is even then $n$ must be even.

When we start modelling objects as rigid bodies we need to also consider the moments on an object (the moment of a force is a measure of its 'turning ability'). To do this we need to know both the size of any forces that are acting on the object and also where the forces are applied. The moment of a force $F = F d$, the perpendicular distance from the pivot $P$ to the line of action of $F$. Note that this means that a force acting at the pivot generates no moment. We can also think of this moment formula as saying that moment = d, the distance to the pivot, the perpendicular part of the force. When several forces act on a body, the resultant moment is found by adding all the individual moments (keeping in mind whether they are acting in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction).  #### Example 1.1  Four forces act on a rod AB, as shown in the diagram below. Calculate the resultant moment on the rod around B, specifying its direction.  ![](img/math/book-2/23.png)  #### Solution 1.1  ![](16.jpg)  ## Equilibrium  For a rigid body to be in equilibrium, there must be both no resultant force on it in any direction and no resultant moment on it around any point. Questions about rigid bodies in equilibrium are often made easier by choosing sensible places to take moments around (and by considering whether to start by looking at the forces or the moments).  #### Example 1.2  The diagram shows a uniform rod, $AB$, of length $4 m$ and weight $15 N$, resting horizontally on two supports at $C$ and $D$, where $AC = 0.5 m$ and $BD = 1 m$. Calculate the magnitude of the reaction force at each of the supports. ![](img/math/book-2/25.png)  #### Solution 1.2  ![](17.jpg)  #### Example 1.3  The base of a ladder, $A$, is standing on rough horizontal ground, with the top, $B$, leaning against a smooth vertical wall. The ladder is at an angle of $55^{\\circ}$ to the horizontal. The ladder has length $10 m$ and mass $20 kg$. A man of mass $80 kg$ is standing on the ladder at a point, $C$. By modelling the ladder as a uniform rod and the man as a particle, find the distance $AC$, given that the magnitude of the frictional force at $A$ is $200 N$.  #### Solution 1.3  ![](18.jpg)  ## 1.3 Centre of Mass  If a rod is uniform then this means that its centre of mass (the place where its weight acts) is in its centre. But if a rod is non-uniform then the weight may act at a different point along the rod. Note that you should assume that a rod is non-uniform unless explicitly told otherwise.  #### Example 1.4  A rod, $AB$, is$ 4 m$ long and has weight $20 N$. It rests horizontally on two supports at $C$ and $D$, where $AC = 0.5 m$ and $BD = 1 m$, as shown below. The magnitude of the reaction force at $C$ is three times the magnitude of the reaction force at $D$. Find the distance of the centre of mass from $A$.  ![](img/math/book-2/26.png)  #### Solution 1.4  ![](27.jpeg)  ## 1.4 Tilting  When a rod sits on two supports, if it is ‘on the point of tilting’ around one of them it means that the other support may as well not be there (ie. the reaction force at that other support is zero). The same logic can also be applied to a rod being held by two strings or wires.  #### Example 1.5  A uniform rod, $AB$, is $4 m$ long and has mass $45 kg$. It rests horizontally on two supports at $C$ and $D$, where $AC = 0.5 m$ and $BD = 1 m$, as shown below. When a mass, $m$ kg, is placed on the rod at $A$, the rod is on the point of tilting about $C$.

Chemical shift is measured in parts per million (ppm) of the radio frequency needed for resonance compared to a reference chemical called tetramethylsilane (TMS). TMS is used universally as the reference compound for NMR because: its methyl groups are particularly well shielded and so it produces a strong, single peak at the far right of an NMR spectrum. The signal from the hydrogen atoms in TMS is defined as having a chemical shift of 0 ppm.  TMS is a good reference as:  * Low boiling point so it is easy to remove. * Gives 1 single, intense signal that resonates upfield from others. * Non-toxic * Inert  ## Carbon NMR  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used for analysing organic compounds. Atoms with odd mass numbers usually show signals on NMR. Many of the carbon atoms on organic molecules are carbon-12. A small quantity of organic molecules will contain the isotope carbon-13 atoms. These will show signals on a 13C NMR. In 13C NMR, the magnetic field strengths of carbon-13 atoms in organic compounds are measured and recorded on a spectrum. All samples are measured against a reference compound – Tetramethylsilane (TMS). On a 13C NMR spectrum, non-equivalent carbon atoms appear as peaks with different chemical shifts.  ### Features of a 13C NMR spectrum  13C NMR spectrum displays sharp single signals. The height of each signal is not proportional to the number of carbon atoms present in a single molecular environment. Carbon atoms in different chemical environments will give resonances at different chemical shifts in a 13C spectrum.  * Each signal indicates carbon atoms with the same molecular environment. * Signals with higher shift values are due to carbon atoms which are closer to electronegative elements, such as oxygen.  #### For example propanone  There are 2 molecular environments. 2 signals will be present on its 13C NMR spectrum.  ![Pasted image 20240507090057.png](/img/chem/22.png)  ### Solvents  NMR spectra are recorded in solution. The sample is dissolved in a proton free solvent to avoid unwanted absorptions.  * For polar substances $\\ce{CDCl3}$ would be used. * For non-polar substances $\\ce{CCl4}$ would be used.   In 13C NMR there would be a peak due to the solvent but at A-level it is usually removed from the spectrum.  ## Counting Peaks  The amount of peaks depends on two things, the neighbouring carbon environment and the distance from oxygen (or a similar electronegative atom, Eg. Group 7).  ## Hydrogen NMR  \\[N+1 rule]  ## Summary  ### TMS  Tms is used as a reference in graphs, it always shows up as a 0 peak on the graph. $\\ce{C\\_{4}H\\_{12}Si}$.  ### Solvents  Solvents can e polar and non polar. For polar substances a polar solution is used, $\\ce{CDCl\\_{3}}$. For non-polar substance a non-polar solvent is used, $\\ce{CCl\\_{4}}$  ### C-NMR  Counting the number of carbon peaks:  * Count the number of different Carbon environments. Two things affect this, the neighbouring carbon environments and the distance from an electronegative atom (usually oxygen).  ### H-NMR  Counting the number of hydrogen peaks:  * It is the same as carbon, however, only carbons with hydrogens are counted.

First ionisation energy denotes the energy needed for each atom is a gaseous state to lose one electron.  Ionisation energy - The energy required to remove one electron from every atom in one \\[\\[chemistry/year 1/Mole]] of a gaseous atoms of an element.  There are several factors that can affect ionisation energy:  * Atomic radius - The greater the distance from the nucleus to the outer shell the less nuclear nuclear attraction the electrons on that shell have. * Nuclear charge - the more protons the nucleus has the greater the nuclear attraction between the nucleus and the outer shell. * Electron shielding - Electrons repel each-other between shell, this is called electron shielding, as the outer shell is pushed further away the attraction to the nucleus decreases  A atom has as many ionisation energies as it has atoms on the outer shell. The *successive* ionisation energies rise, as each electron is lost, and the attraction to the nucleus rises.  ### Making predictions from successive ionisation energies  When there is a big jump in ionisation energy it usually indicates a change in shell as the shielding increases. Thus the group and period of the element can be identified.  ### Trend in ionisation energies  ![trend](/img/chem/13.png)  The figure shows that there are:  * General increase in first ionisation energies across each period as the atomic radius decreases * A sharp drop between the ionisation energy of the last element in one period and the first in the next  However, there are also drops within each period. These can be explained by the filling process of orbitals. The more *unpaired* electrons there are in the outer-most orbital in an atom the higher the ionisation energy. However when there are two paired electrons the repulsion between them makes it easier to remove one electron.  ![orbiatals](/img/chem/14.png) "},{"route":"content/chemistry/year 1/Intermolecular_Forces","title":"Intermolecular Forces","content":"Intermolecular forces - weak interactions between dipoles of different molecules.  | Type of bond          | Bond enthalpy $kJmol^{-1}$ | | ---------------       | ---------------            | | London Forces         | 1-10                       | | Permanent Dipole      | 3-25                       | | Hydrogen Bonds        | 10-40                      | | Single Covalent Bonds | 150-500                    |  ### London Forces  London forces are weak intermolecular forces which exist between all molecules (polar/non-polar). Also known as an induced dipole-induced dipole attraction.  As electrons move around in a molecule their distribution becomes uneven, forming a changing **instantaneous** dipole, which in turn, **induces** a dipole on the neighbouring molecule. This repeats, causing molecules to attract. As such, induced dipoles are temporary.  In a molecule, the larger the amount of electrons:  * The larger the instantaneous and induced dipoles * The greater the induced dipole-dipole interactions * The stronger the attractive forces between molecules  London forces are used to describe induced dipole-dipole interactions **only**  Van der Waals' forces are used to describe both permanent **and** induced dipole-dipole interactions  ### Simple Molecular Substances  A simple molecular substance is made up of simple molecules such as $\\ce{H2O}$ or $\\ce{N2}$ which form a simple molecular lattice. The molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces, the atoms within molecules are held together by strong covalent bonds.  #### Melting and boiling points  Simple molecular have low melting and boiling temperatures as the weak intermolecular require little energy to break. When the simple molecular lattice is broken, only intermolecular forces break not the strong covalent bonds.  #### Solubility  ##### Non-polar  Simple molecular compounds tend to be soluble in non-polar solvents. This is because when added to a non-polar solvent intermolecular forces form between its molecules and the solvent. Those interactions weaken the intermolecular forces in the simple molecular lattice, thus dissolving the compound.  ##### Polar  Solubility depends on the strength of the dipole. Polar covalent substance may dissolve in polar solvent as the polar molecules attract to the polar solvent molecules. The process is similar to dissolving an ionic compound. These rules extend to liquids and gases as well. In some compounds such as $\\ce{C2H5OH}$ contain both polar $O-H$ and non-polar $C-C$ bonds and can thus dissolve in both polar and non-polar solvents.  #### Electrical conductivity  There are no mobile charged particles in a simple molecular lattice and thus they are non-conductors of electricity.  ### Hydrogen Bonding  A hydrogen bond is a special type of permanent dipole-dipole interaction. It can be found between molecules containing an electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons (O, H, F) or a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom.  A hydrogen bonds acts between a lone pair of electrons on an electronegative atom in one molecules and a hydrogen atom in a different molecule (Fig. 1). An hydrogen bond is denoted by a dashed line.  ![hydrogen bonds](/img/chem/9.png) *Fig. 1*  ##### Hydrogen Bonds in Water  Due to having two lone pair on the oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, each water molecule can form four hydrogen bonds, forming an open tetrahedral lattice (Fig. 2) in which a linear $\\ce{H\\bond{...}O\\bond{-}H}$ arrangement holds the water molecules apart ![water](/img/chem/10.png) *Fig. 2*  Water also has a relatively high melting and boiling points than the ones it would have had with normal London forces.

HFCs are chemically inert and are therefore used for a wide range of purposes. Though CFCs have many beneficial uses, they also have devastating effects on the ozone layer:  * CFCs absorb a lot of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere. * The CFCs are then broken down by the UV light causing the formation of chlorine radicals.  These radical react with ozone and break down the ozone layer:  $$ \\ce{Cl^. + O3 -> ClO^. + O2} $$  $$ \\ce{ClO^. + O3 -> 2O2 + Cl^.} $$  $$ \\therefore \\ce{2O3 -> 3O2} $$  ### Other radicals  CFCs are not the only radicals that catalyse the breakdown of the ozone. One of the other sets of radicals linked to ozone breakdown are the nitrogen oxide radicals which can be formed:  * Naturally during lightning strikes * As a result of air travel in the stratosphere * Nitrogen monoxide is formed by the direct combination of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures inside a combustion engine  The nitrogen monoxide formed is a free radical as it has an odd number of electrons / unpaired electron. The nitrogen monoxide radical reacts with one molecule of ozone to form the nitrogen dioxide molecule.  $$ \\ce{NO^. + O3 -> NO2^. + O2} $$  $$ \\ce{NO2^. + O -> NO^. + O2} $$  $$ \\ce{O3 + O -> 2O2} $$ "},{"route":"content/chemistry/year 1/Feedback","title":"Feedback","content":"## Energetics 2 Simonovic  20/32 - 62.5% 4 marks lost to definitions 5 marks lost on attention to details in calculations, mainly signs  * Learn definitions   * Enthalpy change of formation   * Enthalpy change of combustion   * Average bond enthalpy   * Energy CHANGE not energy REQUIRED   *  * Pay attention to significant figures  * Take stoichiometric numbers into consideration when comparing moles  * Changing the volumes in a neutralisation by a factor doesn't change the change in temperature  * Remember whether a reaction is endothermic or exothermic to double check its sign  * Pay attention to details in bon enthalpy questions:   * Number of bonds in a diatomic molecules (1)  * When drawing an enthalpy change diagram the arrow has to go from line to line   **Explain in terms of bond breaking and bond making, why the enthalpy change of formation of NO is endothermic:**  * More energy is required for bond breaking than is released by bond making   **Explain why this equation represents the standard enthalpy change of combustion of butane:**  * One mole of butane **completely** combusts with oxygen  * Carbon is **solid** in room temperature  A reverse reaction's enthalpy is the same value with a different sign "},{"route":"content/chemistry/year 1/Electronegativity","title":"Electronegativity","content":"Electronegativity - ability of a nuclei to pull a pair of electrons towards itself within a covalent bond.

Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GLC) is used for analysing:  * Gases * Volatile liquids * Solids in their vapour form  The stationary phase: A long coiled column with a non-volatile liquid that is adsorbed onto an inert solid support.  The mobile phase: An inert carrier gas (e.g. helium, neon or nitrogen).

For example, we could separate a dye out to determine the mixture of dyes in a forensic sample.  Stationary phase:  * This phase is commonly a thin metal sheet coated in alumina ($\\ce{Al2O3}$) or silica ($\\ce{SiO2}$).  * The solute molecules adsorb onto the surface. * The more the substances are attracted to the stationary phase, the slower they will travel up the chromatogram.  Mobile phase:  * Flows over the stationary phase. * It is a polar or non-polar liquid (solvent) that carries components of the compound being investigated. * Polar solvents - water or alcohol. * Non-polar solvents - alkanes. * If the sample components are coloured, their spots are easily identifiable on the chromatogram. * If the sample components are not coloured, then we can locate the spots on the chromatogram and draw around them in pencil.

Their Rf values are higher than those closer to the baseline. They are more soluble in the mobile phase and get carried forwards with the solvent.  More polar components do not travel far up the plate. They are more attracted to the polar stationary phase.  The extent of separating molecules in the investigated sample depends on the solubility in the mobile and stationary phases.

A covalent bond is localised, acting only on a shared pair of electron between two atoms, this forms a molecule.  Dot and cross diagrams are used to display covalent bonds.  ### Single bonds  ![dot-cross](/img/chem/1.png)  Paired electrons that are not shared (double blue balls) are called lone pairs.  ### 'Excited' state  If an atom gains energy the electron can 'jump' and orbital and become unpaired, thus increasing the number of available electrons in the outer shell.  Eg. Sulfur can have a valency(amount of outer shell electron) of 2,4 and 6, this happens as the paired electrons in 3s and 3p move into the 3d orbital:  ![energy](/img/chem/6.jpg)  ![sulfur](/img/chem/5.png)  ### Multiple bonds  * Double covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between two shared pairs of electrons, most common are:  $$ \\ce{O=O} $$ $$ \\ce{C=O} $$  ![double](/img/chem/2.png)  * Triple covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between three shared pairs of electrons, most common are:  $$ \\ce{N#N} $$ $$ \\ce{H-C#N} $$  ![Triple](/img/chem/3.png)  ### Dative Covalent Bonds  In a dative covalent bonds the shared pair of electrons are supplied by one atom, the shared pair used to be a **lone pair**.  Eg.  $$ \\ce{NH3 + H+ -> NH4+} $$  ![dative](/img/chem/4.png)  The '->' in the second diagram represents that both electrons were given by nitrogen.  An easy way to chek if the dot and cross diagram is correct is by adding up all the electrons in teh outer shells of all the ellements before and after.  ### Average bond enthalpy (brief start)  Average bond enthalpy ($kJmol^{-1}$) is the measurement of covalent bond strength, the larger the average bond enthalpy, the stronger the bond.  ## Molecule Structure  Electron pairs have the same charge and thus repel. Electron shells seek to be as far away from each-other as possible.  Eg. $\\ce{CH4}$ has 4 $\\ce{C-H}$ bonds, they are equal, and thus the shape is a tetrahedral with angles 109.5 between each bond.  ### Wedges  To represent 3D shapes on paper wedges are used:  * **Top** is used to represent a bond in the plane on the paper * **Middle** is used to represent a bond coming out of the plane on the paper * **Bottom** is used to represent a bond going in the plane on the paper  ![wedges](/img/chem/7.png)  A lone pair is slightly closer to the center of an atom than a bonded pair, as it occupies more space.

It is measured in seconds. $T=\\frac{t}{n}$ Where t - time of oscillation, n - number of oscillations * Frequency - Value equal to the inverse of T. $F = \\frac{1}{T}$  Resonance in physics is the feedback of the oscillating system to the periodic interaction with outside, shown in synchronisation of the oscillations of the system with those of the outside interaction, which causes a sharp increase of amplitude of the system.  This way, the frequency  * Resonance frequency V - is the frequency of the outside force, equal to the personal frequency of oscillation of the system, with which the maximum amplitude A is achieved  ## Non Zero Spin  **Nucleus of a chemical element with a non zero spin.** The nucleus can by simplified to by represented as a positively charged ($Z+$) electric ball, due to it having protons with the charge of +1. The charged ball spins along it own axis, due to the laws of electrodynamics, the rotation of the charge leads to a magnetic field, ei the magnetic moment of the nucleus $\\mu$, which is angled along the axis of rotation. If $\\mu$ is placed in the outer magnetic field with the charge $\\vec{B\\_{0}}$, then the vector of $\\vec{\\mu}$ starts to precession, ei. rotate about the direction of the outside magnetic field $\\vec{B\\_{0}}$  ![spin.png](spin.png)  It precesses in the same way if it is spun in a non-vertical way. In this case the the magnetic field acts as the gravity.  There only exists just about hundred isotopes of different chemical elements whose nuclei have the magnetic momentum $\\mu$, which allows us to observe NRM. This  is usually observed in nuclei which have an odd amount of nucleons ei. an odd sum of protons and neutrons. For each of these magnetic nuclei there is a correlation between the strength of their magnetic strength  $\\vec{B\\_{0}}$ and the frequency of the procession of the magnetic field $\\mu$ called hydromagnetic correlation. Using these we can pick a frequency NMR $\\mu$ for which in the magnetic field $\\vec{B\\_{0}}$ will specific nuclei will be observable. \\[Rest of page 6]  ## Observing NRM  If a periodic magnetic field act on a non zero spin nucleus instead of a constant one the nucleus interacts with it, amplifying the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$, and the nucleus absorbs energy of the outer periodic magnetic field. However this will only happen under the condition of resonance, ei. that the frequency of presses ion and the frequency of the outer magnetic field. At the moment of resonance the absorption is amplified which gives a peak on the NMR graph.  \\[Rest of page 7]  ## Rough  Atoms nuclei \"excite\" and spin faster, they then start slowing down at different rates. Once the frequency of spin matches the frequency of the outer periodic magnetic wave, resonance happens, amplifying the wavelength of the nuclei. This is detected and shows up as a peak on the graph. Due to a difference in spin due to chemical shift, different atom groups show up in different parts of the graph. Chemical spin is the interference of magnetic fields of different atomic groups, resulting in different rate of spin of the nuclei.  ## Chemical Shift "}]
