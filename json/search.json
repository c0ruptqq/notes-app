If $n = \\infty$ it is ionised. $\\therefore$ $n=1 -> n=\\infty$ is ionisation energy. Once the electron leaves the atom it has positive energy in the form Kinetic Energy.\n\n## Excitation\nColliding electrons which have a lower energy than the ionisation energy can still cause the atom to absorb their energy without ionisation occurring. This causes the electrons to transition from a lower Energy Level to a higher one - called excitation. Random perturbations in vacuum often cause electrons to fall back down to a lower energy level, causing a photon to be released.

A parametric graph is one in which x and y, instead of being directly linked in a Cartesian equation (like $y = x^2$) are instead both linked to another variable (called a parameter). For example, $y = t^2$, $x = 3t$ is a parametric graph going through (0, 0), (1, 3), (4, 6) etc (each value of t gives an (x, y) point). It is usually possible to find a Cartesian equation for a graph from its parametric equations by eliminating\nthe parameter.\n\n#### Example 8.1\nFind a Cartesian equation for the parametric curve $x=5t$, $y=3t^2$ $(0<t<20)$, stating its domain\n\n#### Solution 8.1\n$$\nx = 5t => t= \\frac x 5\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin {aligned} \\therefore y &=3(\\frac x 5)^2 \\text{ for } 0< \\frac x 5 < 20 \\\\ & = \\frac {3x^2} {25} \\text{ for } 0<x<100 \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor parametric equations involving trig functions, if you can't find a simple way to link x and y, use an appropriate trig identity.\n\n#### Example 8.2\nFind the Cartesian equation of the curve $x=\\sin t + 2$, $y=\\cos t -3$\n\n#### Solution 8.2\n\n$$\nx=\\sin t => \\sin t = x-2\n$$\n\n$$\ny = \\cos t -3 => \\cos t =y+3\n$$\n\n$$\n\\therefore \\cos^2 t\\sin^2 t = 1 => (x-2)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 1\n$$\n\n\n## 8.2 Working with Parametric Equations\n\n#### Example 8.3\n\nThe diagram shows a curve C with parametric equations $x = at^2 + t$, $y = a(t^3 +8)$,  where $a$ is a non-zero constant.

Therefore $\\{U_n\\}$ is arithmetic if and only if $U_{n+1} -U_n = d$ for all positive integers $n$ where $d$ is a constants number (known as the common difference). To find any term of an arithmetic sequence all we need to know is the term number and the common difference.  So $U_1$ is the first term (given the letter $a$)  then the second term $U_2 = U_1 +d$, $U_3 = U_1 + 2d$ and so on. Therefore the general term $U_n = a + (n-1)d$.\n\n## 3.2 Arithmetic Series\nA *series* is formed by adding together the terms in a sequence (so the series $S_n$ is defined to be the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence; in other words $S_n = u_1 + u_2 + ... + u_n$). The sum of a series is the result when all the terms in the series have been added. An arithmetic series is a series based on an arithmetic sequence. Therefore for an arithmetic series:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} S_n & = u_1 + u_2 + ... + u_n \\\\ & = a + (a+d) + (a+2d)+...+(a+(n-2)d)+(a+(n-1)d)(*) \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nWriting this in reverse we have:\n\n$$\nS_n = (a+(n-1)d) + (a + (n-2)d)+ ...+(a+2d)+(a+d)+a (+) \n$$\n\nAdding (\\*) and (+) gives:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} 2S_n &= 2a + (n-1)d + 2a + (n-1)d +...+2a+(n-1)d + 2a + (n-1)d \\text{[n times]} \\\\ & = n(2a+ (n-1)d)  \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\therefore S_n=\\frac n 2(2a+(n-1)d) \\text{ or else, equivalently, }S_n= \\frac n 2 (a+l) \\text{ , where l is the last term being summed}\n$$\n\n## 3.3 Geometric Sequences\nA *geometric sequence* is one where every term is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero constant. Therefore $\\{U_n\\}$ is geometric if and only if $\\frac {U_n+1} {U_n} = r$, for all positive integers $n$, where $r$ is a constant number (known as the *common ratio*). To find any term of a geometric sequence, All we need to know is the first term and the common ratio. So if *a* is the first term of our sequence then $u_2 = ar$. Therefore, the general term is given by $u_n = u_1*r^{n-1}$. \n## 3.4 Geometric Series\nA *geometric series* is based on a geometric sequence. Therefore, for a geometric series,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}S_n & = u_1 + u_2 + ...+ u_n \\\\ & = a + ar + ar^2 + ... + r^{n-1} \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n \\therefore rS_n = ar + ar^2 + ... + ar^n \n$$\n\n\n$$\n\\therefore rS_n -S_n = ar^n-a=a(r^n-1)\n$$\n\n$$\n\\therefore S_n = \\frac {a(r^n-1)} {r-1}\n$$\n\nor, equivalently, \n\n$$\nS_n = \\frac {a(1-r^n)} {1-r}\n$$\n\nfor $r \\neq 1$ \n## 3.5 Sum to Infinity\nIf $-1 < r <1$ then when $n$ is very large $r^n \\approx 0$ so $S_n$ will get closer and closer to $\\frac a {1-r}$.\nWe say that the series *converges* and has a sum to infinity ($S_{\\infty}$)of $\\frac a {1-a}$.\n\n## 3.6 Sigma Notation\n\nTo save time, sums can be written using sigma ($\\Sigma$) notation. \n\n$$\n\\sum_{r=a}^{b} f(r)\n$$\n\nmeans add up all the terms you get from putting $r=a$ into a fraction and then $r=a+1$ in and so on until you get to $r=b$ \n## 3.6 Recurrence Relations\nRather than giving a direct formula for $u_n$ , an alternative approach is to use *recurrence relations* where each term is defined in terms of the previous term (or terms).

This means that mappings are only functions if ther are one-to-one or many-to-one.\nFor example, $\\frac 1 x$ isn't a function iof 0 is in the domain (since 0 wouldn't be mapped to anything). Similarly, $\\pm \\sqrt{x}$ isn't a function even if we restrict the domain to positive numbers) since every element of the domain would be mapped to two things in the range (eg. $16 -> \\pm 4$).\nNote that this means that whether something is or isn't a function can depend as much on the domain as it does on the algebraic rule being applied. This means that it is crucial that the domain of a function is specified as part of its definition. \nNote that if we graph a mapping we can see quickly whether it is a function; any vertical line must hit the graph exactly once for each x-value in the domain for the mapping to be a function.\n\n#### Example 2.3\nFor each of the following mappings, state whether the mapping is one-to-one, many-to-one or one-to-many and state whether it represents a function.\n![img/math/book-2/5.jpeg](/img/math/book-2/5.jpeg)\n#### Solution 2.3\n- a) One-to-many\n- b) One-to-one; is a function\n- c) If 0 is excluded its a function\n- d) Many-to-one; is a function\n\n## 2.5 Composite Functions\n\nWe can combine functions to make new ones called *composite functions*. If $f$ and $g$ are two functions then $fg(x)$ (or $f * g(x)$) means to do $g$ to $x$ and then do $f$.\n\n#### Example 2.5\nLet $f(x) = 2x+1$ and $g(x)=x^2-4$ find $fg(x)$\n#### Solution 2.5\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned} fg(x) & = f(x^2-4) \\\\ &= 2(x^2-4) +1 \\\\ &= 2x^2 -8 +1\\\\&= 2x^2-7 \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n## Inverse Functions\nThe inverse function of $f$ (called $f^{-1}$) 'undoes' the function so doing $f$ and $f^{-1}$ to something is the equivalent of not doing anything.\nNote that:\n1) Only one-to-one functions have inverse functions (since if a function is many-to-one the inverse mapping will be one-to-many so won't be a function)\n2) The graph of $y = f^{-1}(x)$ is a reflection of the graph of $y = f(x)$  in the line $y = x$\n3) The domain of $f$ if the range of $f^{-1}$\n4) The range of $f$ if the domain of $f^{-1}$\n\nThis first point means that for many-to-one functions we sometimes need to restrict the domain of the function before we are able to find the inverse (eg. $f(x) = x^2$ has no inverse for the domain $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ but does for the domain $x \\geq 0$.\nThe last two points mean that we can answer questions about the domain and range of an inverse function without ever needing to work out what the definition of the inverse function is.\n"},{"route":"content/math/Year 2/Chapter 12","title":"Chapter 12","content":"# 12 Vectors\n## 12.1 3D Coordinates\n\nUse the right hand rule to visualise (x,y,z):\n- Thumb (x)\n- Index (y)\n- Middle (z)\n\nIn 3D we need a z-axis.\nCoordinates are given as (x, y, z).

When we start modelling objects as rigid bodies we need to also consider the moments on an object (the moment of a force is a measure of its 'turning ability'). To do this we need to know both the size of any forces that are acting on the object and also where the forces are applied. The moment of a force $F = F d$, the perpendicular distance from the pivot $P$ to the line of action of $F$. Note that this means that a force acting at the pivot generates no moment. We can also think of this moment formula as saying that moment = d, the distance to the pivot, the perpendicular part of the force. When several forces act on a body, the resultant moment is found by adding all the individual moments (keeping in mind whether they are acting in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction).\n\n#### Example 1.1\nFour forces act on a rod AB, as shown in the diagram below. Calculate the resultant moment on the rod around B, specifying its direction.\n\n![](img/math/book-2/23.png)\n#### Solution 1.1\n![](16.jpg)\n\n## Equilibrium\nFor a rigid body to be in equilibrium, there must be both no resultant force on it in any direction and no resultant moment on it around any point. Questions about rigid bodies in equilibrium are often made easier by choosing sensible places to take moments around (and by considering whether to start by looking at the forces or the moments).\n#### Example 1.2\nThe diagram shows a uniform rod, $AB$, of length $4 m$ and weight $15 N$, resting horizontally on two supports at $C$ and $D$, where $AC = 0.5 m$ and $BD = 1 m$.

The ladder is at an angle of $55^{\\circ}$ to the horizontal. The ladder has length $10 m$ and mass $20 kg$. A man of mass $80 kg$ is standing on the ladder at a point, $C$. By modelling the ladder as a uniform rod and the man as a particle, find the distance $AC$, given that the magnitude of the frictional force at $A$ is $200 N$.\n#### Solution 1.3\n![](18.jpg)\n\n## 1.3 Centre of Mass\nIf a rod is uniform then this means that its centre of mass (the place where its weight acts) is in its centre. But if a rod is non-uniform then the weight may act at a different point along the rod. Note that you should assume that a rod is non-uniform unless explicitly told otherwise.\n\n#### Example 1.4\nA rod, $AB$, is$ 4 m$ long and has weight $20 N$. It rests horizontally on two supports at $C$ and $D$, where $AC = 0.5 m$ and $BD = 1 m$, as shown below. The magnitude of the reaction force at $C$ is three times the magnitude of the reaction force at $D$. Find the distance of the centre of mass from $A$.\n\n![](img/math/book-2/26.png)\n\n#### Solution 1.4\n![](27.jpeg)\n## 1.4 Tilting\nWhen a rod sits on two supports, if it is ‘on the point of tilting’ around one of them it means that the other support may as well not be there (ie. the reaction force at that other support is zero). The same logic can also be applied to a rod being held by two strings or wires.\n\n#### Example 1.5\nA uniform rod, $AB$, is $4 m$ long and has mass $45 kg$. It rests horizontally on two supports at $C$ and $D$, where $AC = 0.5 m$ and $BD = 1 m$, as shown below. When a mass, $m$ kg, is placed on the rod at $A$, the rod is on the point of tilting about $C$. Find the value of $m$.\n\n#### Solution 1.5\n![](img/math/book-2/19.jpeg)\n\n"},{"route":"content/math/MIsc/Feedback","title":"Feedback","content":"# Easter trials\n## Further\n### Further

placed in the mass spectrometer\n- The sample is vaporised and then ionised to form positive Ions\n- The ions are accelerated. Heavier ions move more slowly and are more difficult to deflect than lighter ions, so the ions of each isotopes are separated.\n- The ions are detected on a mass spectrum as a mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) \n$$\n{\\frac m z} = {\\frac {\\text{relative mass of ion}} {\\text{relative charge of ion}}}\n$$\n\n"},{"route":"content/chemistry/year 1/NMR","title":"NMR","content":"# NMR\n\nThe horizontal scale on an NMR spectrum represents chemical shift (δ). Chemical shift is measured in parts per million (ppm) of the radio frequency needed for resonance compared to a reference chemical called tetramethylsilane (TMS). TMS is used universally as the reference compound for NMR because: its methyl groups are particularly well shielded and so it produces a strong, single peak at the far right of an NMR spectrum. The signal from the hydrogen atoms in TMS is defined as having a chemical shift of 0 ppm.\n\nTMS is a good reference as:\n- Low boiling point so it is easy to remove.\n- Gives 1 single, intense signal that resonates upfield from others.\n- Non-toxic\n- Inert\n\n## Carbon NMR\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used for analysing organic compounds.\nAtoms with odd mass numbers usually show signals on NMR. Many of the carbon atoms on organic molecules are carbon-12. A small quantity of organic molecules will contain the isotope carbon-13 atoms. These will show signals on a 13C NMR. In 13C NMR, the magnetic field strengths of carbon-13 atoms in organic compounds are measured and recorded on a spectrum.\nAll samples are measured against a reference compound – Tetramethylsilane (TMS). On a 13C NMR spectrum, non-equivalent carbon atoms appear as peaks with different chemical shifts.\n\n\n### Features of a 13C NMR spectrum\n13C NMR spectrum displays sharp single signals.\nThe height of each signal is not proportional to the number of carbon atoms present in a single molecular environment. Carbon atoms in different chemical environments will give resonances at different chemical shifts in a 13C spectrum. \n- Each signal indicates carbon atoms with the same molecular environment.\n- Signals with higher shift values are due to carbon atoms which are closer to electronegative elements, such as oxygen.\n\n#### For example propanone\nThere are 2 molecular environments. 2 signals will be present on its 13C NMR spectrum.\n\n![Pasted image 20240507090057.png](/img/chem/22.png)\n\n### Solvents\nNMR spectra are recorded in solution.\nThe sample is dissolved in a proton free solvent to avoid unwanted absorptions.\n- For polar substances $\\ce{CDCl3}$ would be used.\n- For non-polar substances $\\ce{CCl4}$ would be used.\nIn 13C NMR there would be a peak due to the solvent but at A-level it is usually removed from the spectrum.\n\n\n## Counting Peaks\nThe amount of peaks depends on two things, the neighbouring carbon environment and the distance from oxygen (or a similar electronegative atom, Eg. Group 7). \n\n## Hydrogen NMR\n[N+1 rule]\n\n## Summary\n### TMS\nTms is used as a reference in graphs, it always shows up as a 0 peak on the graph. $\\ce{C_{4}H_{12}Si}$. \n### Solvents\nSolvents can e polar and non polar. For polar substances a polar solution is used, $\\ce{CDCl_{3}}$.

First ionisation energy denotes the energy needed for each atom is a gaseous state to lose one electron. \n\nIonisation energy - The energy required to remove one electron from every atom in one [[chemistry/year 1/Mole]] of a gaseous atoms of an element.\n\nThere are several factors that can affect ionisation energy:\n\n- Atomic radius - The greater the distance from the nucleus to the outer shell the less nuclear nuclear attraction the electrons on that shell have.\n- Nuclear charge - the more protons the nucleus has the greater the nuclear attraction between the nucleus and the outer shell.\n- Electron shielding - Electrons repel each-other between shell, this is called electron shielding, as the outer shell is pushed further away the attraction to the nucleus decreases\n\nA atom has as many ionisation energies as it has atoms on the outer shell. The _successive_ ionisation energies rise, as each electron is lost, and the attraction to the nucleus rises.\n\n\n### Making predictions from successive ionisation energies\n\nWhen there is a big jump in ionisation energy it usually indicates a change in shell as the shielding increases. Thus the group and period of the element can be identified.\n\n### Trend in ionisation energies\n\n![trend](/img/chem/13.png)\n\nThe figure shows that there are:\n- General increase in first ionisation energies across each period as the atomic radius decreases\n- A sharp drop between the ionisation energy of the last element in one period and the first in the next\n\nHowever, there are also drops within each period. These can be explained by the filling process of orbitals. The more _unpaired_ electrons there are in the outer-most orbital in an atom the higher the ionisation energy. However when there are two paired electrons the repulsion between them makes it easier to remove one electron.\n\n![orbiatals](/img/chem/14.png)\n\n\n\n"},{"route":"content/chemistry/year 1/Intermolecular_Forces","title":"Intermolecular Forces","content":"\nIntermolecular forces - weak interactions between dipoles of different molecules.\n\n| Type of bond          | Bond enthalpy $kJmol^{-1}$ |\n| ---------------       | ---------------            |\n| London Forces         | 1-10                       |\n| Permanent Dipole      | 3-25                       |\n| Hydrogen Bonds        | 10-40                      |\n| Single Covalent Bonds | 150-500                    |\n\n### London Forces\n\nLondon forces are weak intermolecular forces which exist between all molecules (polar/non-polar). Also known as an induced dipole-induced dipole attraction.\n\nAs electrons move around in a molecule their distribution becomes uneven, forming a changing __instantaneous__ dipole, which in turn, __induces__ a dipole on the neighbouring molecule. This repeats, causing molecules to attract. As such, induced dipoles are temporary. \n\nIn a molecule, the larger the amount of electrons:\n- The larger the instantaneous and induced dipoles\n- The greater the induced dipole-dipole interactions\n- The stronger the attractive forces between molecules\n\nLondon forces are used to describe induced dipole-dipole interactions __only__\n\nVan der Waals' forces are used to describe both permanent __and__ induced dipole-dipole interactions\n\n### Simple Molecular Substances \n\nA simple molecular substance is made up of simple molecules such as $\\ce{H2O}$ or $\\ce{N2}$ which form a simple molecular lattice. The molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces, the atoms within molecules are held together by strong covalent bonds. \n\n#### Melting and boiling points\nSimple molecular have low melting and boiling temperatures as the weak intermolecular require little energy to break. When the simple molecular lattice is broken, only intermolecular forces break not the strong covalent bonds.\n\n#### Solubility \n\n##### Non-polar\n\nSimple molecular compounds tend to be soluble in non-polar solvents. This is because when added to a non-polar solvent intermolecular forces form between its molecules and the solvent. Those interactions weaken the intermolecular forces in the simple molecular lattice, thus dissolving the compound. \n\n##### Polar\n\nSolubility depends on the strength of the dipole. Polar covalent substance may dissolve in polar solvent as the polar molecules attract to the polar solvent molecules. The process is similar to dissolving an ionic compound. These rules extend to liquids and gases as well. In some compounds such as $\\ce{C2H5OH}$ contain both polar $O-H$ and non-polar $C-C$ bonds and can thus dissolve in both polar and non-polar solvents.\n\n#### Electrical conductivity\n\nThere are no mobile charged particles in a simple molecular lattice and thus they are non-conductors of electricity. \n\n### Hydrogen Bonding \n\n\nA hydrogen bond is a special type of permanent dipole-dipole interaction. It can be found between molecules containing an electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons (O, H, F) or a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom.\n\nA hydrogen bonds acts between a lone pair of electrons on an electronegative atom in one molecules and a hydrogen atom in a different molecule (Fig. 1). An hydrogen bond is denoted by a dashed line. \n\n![hydrogen bonds](/img/chem/9.png) \n*Fig. 1*\n\n##### Hydrogen Bonds in Water\n\nDue to having two lone pair on the oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, each water molecule can form four hydrogen bonds, forming an open tetrahedral lattice (Fig. 2)\nin which a linear $\\ce{H\\bond{...}O\\bond{-}H}$ arrangement holds the water molecules apart \n![water](/img/chem/10.png)\n*Fig. 2*\n\nWater also has a relatively high melting and boiling points than the ones it would have had with normal London forces.

Sulfur can have a valency(amount of outer shell electron) of 2,4 and 6, this happens as the paired electrons in 3s and 3p move into the 3d orbital:\n\n![energy](/img/chem/6.jpg) \n\n![sulfur](/img/chem/5.png) \n\n### Multiple bonds\n\n- Double covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between two shared pairs of electrons, most common are:\n\n$$\n\\ce{O=O}\n$$\n$$\n\\ce{C=O}\n$$\n\n![double](/img/chem/2.png) \n\n\n- Triple covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between three shared pairs of electrons, most common are:\n\n$$\n\\ce{N#N}\n$$\n$$\n\\ce{H-C#N}\n$$\n\n![Triple](/img/chem/3.png) \n\n### Dative Covalent Bonds\n\nIn a dative covalent bonds the shared pair of electrons are supplied by one atom, the shared pair used to be a __lone pair__. \n\nEg. \n\n$$\n\\ce{NH3 + H+ -> NH4+}\n$$\n\n![dative](/img/chem/4.png) \n\nThe '->' in the second diagram represents that both electrons were given by nitrogen.\n\nAn easy way to chek if the dot and cross diagram is correct is by adding up all the electrons in teh outer shells of all the ellements before and after.\n\n\n### Average bond enthalpy (brief start)\n\nAverage bond enthalpy ($kJmol^{-1}$) is the measurement of covalent bond strength, the larger the average bond enthalpy, the stronger the bond. \n\n\n## Molecule Structure\n\nElectron pairs have the same charge and thus repel. Electron shells seek to be as far away from each-other as possible. \n\nEg. $\\ce{CH4}$ has 4 $\\ce{C-H}$ bonds, they are equal, and thus the shape is a tetrahedral with angles 109.5 between each bond. \n\n### Wedges \n\nTo represent 3D shapes on paper wedges are used:\n\n- __Top__ is used to represent a bond in the plane on the paper\n- __Middle__ is used to represent a bond coming out of the plane on the paper\n- __Bottom__ is used to represent a bond going in the plane on the paper\n\n![wedges](/img/chem/7.png)\n\nA lone pair is slightly closer to the center of an atom than a bonded pair, as it occupies more space. Thus it repels more strongly.\n\nThus:\n\nbonded/bonded < bonded/lone < lone/lone\n\nMore examples:\n\n![d](/img/chem/8.jpg) \n\nGenerally, with each lone pair the angle decreases approximately by 2.5 degrees.\n\nIf a molecule as multiple bonds (eg. $\\ce{=}$) each multiple bond is treated as a region. Thus in a $\\ce{CO2}$ molecule the angles between bonds is 180 as the bonds are treated as $\\ce{O=C=O}$. Another interesting molecule is $\\ce{SF6}$\n\n![d](/img/chem/9.jpeg) \n\nThe angle is 90 as the shape of the molecule is _octohedral_ thus between _eachother_ the angle beween electrons is 90\n\n"},{"route":"content/chemistry/year 1/Alcohols","title":"Alcohols","content":"\n## Elimination\nAlcohols can also undergo dehydration to form alkenes.

non-zero spin in the outer magnetic field $\\vec{B_{0}}$ in the frequency $\\mu$ (called the NRM frequency). According to the laws of quantum mechanics, the energy of interaction of the magnetic nucleus of a chemical element (which has a magnetic moment $\\mu$) with the outer magnetic field with the direction $\\vec{B_{0}}$ it can only accept a few discrete values. If magnetic nuclei are subjected to a constant magnetic field $\\vec{B_{0}}$ with a periodic magnetic field, whose energy corresponds with the difference between these discrete energy levels expressed in frequency units ($E=H\\times v$, $V \\times \\lambda = C$, where E - is energy of electromagnetic wave, V - Frequency of electromagnetic wave, $\\lambda$ - Length of the electromagnetic wave. C - Speed of light, H - Planck's constant) then the magnetic nuclei (which have a personal magnetic moment $\\mu$) start to travel from one discrete energetic level to another, absorbing energy (identical in frequency) periodic magnetic field.\n\nElectron spin - \n\n### Looking at resonance\n[[physics/year 1/Circular motion]]\nBefore discussing resonance we must first look at oscillation. [[physics/year 1/Circular motion| Oscillation]]  - repeating process of changing the state of a system near the point of centre of mass.  Oscillation are described with certain physical terms:\n- Amplitude (A) - The maximum value of displacement from the normal \n- Period (T) - The time for an object to complete one whole oscillation with the amplitude A. It is measured in seconds. $T=\\frac{t}{n}$ Where t - time of oscillation, n - number of oscillations\n- Frequency - Value equal to the inverse of T. $F = \\frac{1}{T}$\n\nResonance in physics is the feedback of the oscillating system to the periodic interaction with outside, shown in synchronisation of the oscillations of the system with those of the outside interaction, which causes a sharp increase of amplitude of the system.  This way, the frequency \n\n- Resonance frequency V - is the frequency of the outside force, equal to the personal frequency of oscillation of the system, with which the maximum amplitude A is achieved\n\n\n## Non Zero Spin\n**Nucleus of a chemical element with a non zero spin.** The nucleus can by simplified to by represented as a positively charged ($Z+$) electric ball, due to it having protons with the charge of +1. The charged ball spins along it own axis, due to the laws of electrodynamics, the rotation of the charge leads to a magnetic field, ei the magnetic moment of the nucleus $\\mu$, which is angled along the axis of rotation. If $\\mu$ is placed in the outer magnetic field with the charge $\\vec{B_{0}}$, then the vector of $\\vec{\\mu}$ starts to precession, ei. rotate about the direction of the outside magnetic field $\\vec{B_{0}}$\n\n![spin.png](spin.png)\n\nIt precesses in the same way if it is spun in a non-vertical way. In this case the the magnetic field acts as the gravity.\n\nThere only exists just about hundred isotopes of different chemical elements whose nuclei have the magnetic momentum $\\mu$, which allows us to observe NRM. This  is usually observed in nuclei which have an odd amount of nucleons ei. an odd sum of protons and neutrons. For each of these magnetic nuclei there is a correlation between the strength of their magnetic strength  $\\vec{B_{0}}$ and the frequency of the procession of the magnetic field $\\mu$ called hydromagnetic correlation. Using these we can pick a frequency NMR $\\mu$ for which in the magnetic field $\\vec{B_{0}}$ will specific nuclei will be observable.\n[Rest of page 6]\n\n## Observing NRM\nIf a periodic magnetic field act on a non zero spin nucleus instead of a constant one the nucleus interacts with it, amplifying the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}$, and the nucleus absorbs energy of the outer periodic magnetic field. However this will only happen under the condition of resonance, ei. that the frequency of presses ion and the frequency of the outer magnetic field. At the moment of resonance the absorption is amplified which gives a peak on the NMR graph.\n\n[Rest of page 7]\n\n\n## Rough\nAtoms nuclei \"excite\" and spin faster, they then start slowing down at different rates. Once the frequency of spin matches the frequency of the outer periodic magnetic wave, resonance happens, amplifying the wavelength of the nuclei. This is detected and shows up as a peak on the graph. Due to a difference in spin due to chemical shift, different atom groups show up in different parts of the graph. Chemical spin is the interference of magnetic fields of different atomic groups, resulting in different rate of spin of the nuclei. \n\n## Chemical Shift\n"}]
