bonds as σ-bonds (overlap of orbitals directly between the bonding atoms); free rotation of the σ-bond- (b) explanation of the tetrahedral shape and bond angle around each carbon atom in alkanes in terms of electron pair repulsion- (c) explanation of the variations in boiling points of alkanes with different carbon-chain length and branching, in terms of induced dipole–dipole interactions (London forces).Reactions of alkanes- (d) the low reactivity of alkanes with many reagents in terms of the high bond enthalpy and very low polarity of the σ-bonds present.- (e) complete combustion of alkanes, as used in fuels, and the incomplete combustion of alkane fuels in a limited supply of oxygen with the resulting potential dangers from CO- (f) the reaction of alkanes with chlorine and bromine by radical substitution using ultraviolet radiation, including a mechanism involving homolytic fission and radical reactions in terms of initiation, propagation and termination.- (g) the limitations of radical substitution in synthesis by the formation of a mixture of organic products, in terms of further substitution and reactions at different positions in a carbon chain.4.1.3 AlkenesProperties of alkenes- (a) alkenes as unsaturated hydrocarbons containing a C=C bond comprising a π-bond (sideways overlap of adjacent p-orbitals above and below the bonding C atoms) and a σ-bond (overlap of orbitals directly between the bonding atoms)- (b) explanation of the trigonal planar shape and bond angle around each carbon in the C=C of alkenes in terms of electron pair repulsion.Stereoisomerism in alkenes- (c) (i) explanation of the terms: • stereoisomers (compounds with the same structural formula but with a different arrangement in space)- • E/Z isomerism (an example of stereoisomerism, in terms of restricted rotation about a double bond and the requirement for two different groups to be attached to each carbon atom of the C=C group)- • cis–trans isomerism (a special case of E/Z isomerism in which two of the substituent groups attached to each carbon atom of the C=C group are the same)- (ii) use of Cahn–Ingold–Prelog (CIP) priority rules to identify the E and Z stereoisomers- (d) determination of possible E/Z or cis–trans stereoisomers of an organic molecule, given its structural formulaAddition reactions of alkenes- (e) the reactivity of alkenes in terms of the relatively low bond enthalpy of the π-bond- (f) addition reactions of alkenes with: (i) hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g. Ni, to form alkanes (ii) halogens to form dihaloalkanes, including the use of bromine to detect the presence of a double C=C bond as a test for unsaturation in a carbon chain (iii) hydrogen halides to form haloalkanes (iv) steam in the presence of an acid catalyst, e.g. H3PO4, to form alcohols- (g) definition and use of the term electrophile (an electron pair acceptor)- (h) the mechanism of electrophilic addition in alkenes by heterolytic fission- (i) use of Markownikof’s rule to predict formation of a major organic product in addition reactions of H–X to unsymmetrical alkenes, e.g. H–Br to propene, in terms of the relative stabilities of carbocations intermediates in the mechanismPolymers from alkenes- (j) addition polymerisation of alkenes and substituted alkenes, including: (i) the repeat unit of an addition polymer deduced from a given monomer (ii) identification of the monomer that would produce a given section of an addition polymerWaste polymers and alternatives:- (k) the benefits for sustainability of processing waste polymers by: (i) combustion for energy production (ii) use as an organic feedstock for the production of plastics and other organic chemicals (iii) removal of toxic waste products, e.g. removal of HCl formed during disposal by combustion of halogenated plastics (e.g. PVC).- (l) the benefits to the environment of development of biodegradable and photodegradable polymers.

As processes within the atom occur, electrons are able to transition between energy levels depending on their energies. n=1 is the lowest possible energy an electron can have - the ground state energy.34.pngThe energies are negative, as the electrons \"owe\" the atom energy to leave the atom.IonisationEnergy levels can be used to understand ionisation. high energy electron colliding with an atom can cause the ejection of an inner shell electron from an atom causing what is called ionisation. If  it is ionised.   is ionisation energy. Once the electron leaves the atom it has positive energy in the form Kinetic Energy.ExcitationColliding electrons which have a lower energy than the ionisation energy can still cause the atom to absorb their energy without ionisation occurring.

We call the initial set the domain and the resulting set the range. For example:img/math/book-2/4.jpegA function is a specific type of mapping where every element in the domain goes to exactly one element in the range. This means that mappings are only functions if ther are one-to-one or many-to-one.For example,  isn't a function iof 0 is in the domain (since 0 wouldn't be mapped to anything). Similarly,  isn't a function even if we restrict the domain to positive numbers) since every element of the domain would be mapped to two things in the range (eg. ).Note that this means that whether something is or isn't a function can depend as much on the domain as it does on the algebraic rule being applied. This means that it is crucial that the domain of a function is specified as part of its definition.Note that if we graph a mapping we can see quickly whether it is a function; any vertical line must hit the graph exactly once for each x-value in the domain for the mapping to be a function.Example 2.3For each of the following mappings, state whether the mapping is one-to-one, many-to-one or one-to-many and state whether it represents a function.img/math/book-2/5.jpegSolution 2.3a) One-to-manyb) One-to-one; is a functionc) If 0 is excluded its a functiond) Many-to-one; is a function2.5 Composite FunctionsWe can combine functions to make new ones called composite functions.

When we start modelling objects as rigid bodies we need to also consider the moments on an object (the moment of a force is a measure of its 'turning ability'). To do this we need to know both the size of any forces that are acting on the object and also where the forces are applied. The moment of a force , the perpendicular distance from the pivot  to the line of action of . Note that this means that a force acting at the pivot generates no moment. We can also think of this moment formula as saying that moment = d, the distance to the pivot, the perpendicular part of the force. When several forces act on a body, the resultant moment is found by adding all the individual moments (keeping in mind whether they are acting in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction).Example 1.1Four forces act on a rod AB, as shown in the diagram below. Calculate the resultant moment on the rod around B, specifying its direction.Solution 1.1EquilibriumFor a rigid body to be in equilibrium, there must be both no resultant force on it in any direction and no resultant moment on it around any point. Questions about rigid bodies in equilibrium are often made easier by choosing sensible places to take moments around (and by considering whether to start by looking at the forces or the moments).Example 1.2The diagram shows a uniform rod, , of length  and weight , resting horizontally on two supports at  and , where  and . Calculate the magnitude of the reaction force at each of the supports.Solution 1.2Example 1.3The base of a ladder, , is standing on rough horizontal ground, with the top, , leaning against a smooth vertical wall. The ladder is at an angle of  to the horizontal. The ladder has length  and mass . A man of mass  is standing on the ladder at a point, . By modelling the ladder as a uniform rod and the man as a particle, find the distance , given that the magnitude of the frictional force at  is .Solution 1.31.3 Centre of MassIf a rod is uniform then this means that its centre of mass (the place where its weight acts) is in its centre. But if a rod is non-uniform then the weight may act at a different point along the rod. Note that you should assume that a rod is non-uniform unless explicitly told otherwise.Example 1.4A rod, , is long and has weight . It rests horizontally on two supports at  and , where  and , as shown below. The magnitude of the reaction force at  is three times the magnitude of the reaction force at . Find the distance of the centre of mass from .Solution 1.41.4 TiltingWhen a rod sits on two supports, if it is ‘on the point of tilting’ around one of them it means that the other support may as well not be there (ie. the reaction force at that other support is zero). The same logic can also be applied to a rod being held by two strings or wires.Example 1.5A uniform rod, , is  long and has mass . It rests horizontally on two supports at  and , where  and , as shown below. When a mass,  kg, is placed on the rod at , the rod is on the point of tilting about .

responsible for the characteristic reactions of a compound)- (iii) alkyl group (of formula CnH2n+1)- (iv) aliphatic (a compound containing carbon and hydrogen joined together in straight chains, branched chains or non-aromatic rings)- (v) alicyclic (an aliphatic compound arranged in non-aromatic rings with or without side chains)- (vi) aromatic (a compound containing a benzene ring) (vii)

of each bonding atom receiving one electron from the bonded pair, forming two radicals) (ii) heterolytic fission (in terms of one bonding atom receiving both electrons from the bonded pair).- (g) the term radical (a species with an unpaired electron) and use of ‘dots’ to represent species that are radicals in mechanisms- (h) a ‘curly arrow’ described as the movement of an electron pair, showing either heterolytic fission or formation of a covalent bond- (i) reaction mechanisms, using diagrams, to show clearly the movement of an electron pair with ‘curly arrows’ and relevant dipoles.

Chemical shift is measured in parts per million (ppm) of the radio frequency needed for resonance compared to a reference chemical called tetramethylsilane (TMS).

Many of the carbon atoms on organic molecules are carbon-12. A small quantity of organic molecules will contain the isotope carbon-13 atoms. These will show signals on a 13C NMR. In 13C NMR, the magnetic field strengths of carbon-13 atoms in organic compounds are measured and recorded on a spectrum.All samples are measured against a reference compound – Tetramethylsilane (TMS).

The successive ionisation energies rise, as each electron is lost, and the attraction to the nucleus rises.Making predictions from successive ionisation energiesWhen there is a big jump in ionisation energy it usually indicates a change in shell as the shielding increases. Thus the group and period of the element can be identified.Trend in ionisation energiestrendThe figure shows that there are:General increase in first ionisation energies across each period as the atomic radius decreasesA sharp drop between the ionisation energy of the last element in one period and the first in the nextHowever, there are also drops within each period. These can be explained by the filling process of orbitals. The more unpaired electrons there are in the outer-most orbital in an atom the higher the ionisation energy.

Also known as an induced dipole-induced dipole attraction.As electrons move around in a molecule their distribution becomes uneven, forming a changing instantaneous dipole, which in turn, induces a dipole on the neighbouring molecule. This repeats, causing molecules to attract. As such, induced dipoles are temporary.In a molecule, the larger the amount of electrons:The larger the instantaneous and induced dipolesThe greater the induced dipole-dipole interactionsThe stronger the attractive forces between moleculesLondon forces are used to describe induced dipole-dipole interactions onlyVan der Waals' forces are used to describe both permanent and induced dipole-dipole interactionsSimple Molecular SubstancesA simple molecular substance is made up of simple molecules such as  or  which form a simple molecular lattice. The molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces, the atoms within molecules are held together by strong covalent bonds.Melting and boiling pointsSimple molecular have low melting and boiling temperatures as the weak intermolecular require little energy to break. When the simple molecular lattice is broken, only intermolecular forces break not the strong covalent bonds.SolubilityNon-polarSimple molecular compounds tend to be soluble in non-polar solvents. This is because when added to a non-polar solvent intermolecular forces form between its molecules and the solvent. Those interactions weaken the intermolecular forces in the simple molecular lattice, thus dissolving the compound.PolarSolubility depends on the strength of the dipole. Polar covalent substance may dissolve in polar solvent as the polar molecules attract to the polar solvent molecules. The process is similar to dissolving an ionic compound. These rules extend to liquids and gases as well. In some compounds such as  contain both polar  and non-polar  bonds and can thus dissolve in both polar and non-polar solvents.Electrical conductivityThere are no mobile charged particles in a simple molecular lattice and thus they are non-conductors of electricity.Hydrogen BondingA hydrogen bond is a special type of permanent dipole-dipole interaction. It can be found between molecules containing an electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons (O, H, F) or a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom.A hydrogen bonds acts between a lone pair of electrons on an electronegative atom in one molecules and a hydrogen atom in a different molecule (Fig. 1). An hydrogen bond is denoted by a dashed line.hydrogen bondsFig. 1Hydrogen Bonds in WaterDue to having two lone pair on the oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, each water molecule can form four hydrogen bonds, forming an open tetrahedral lattice (Fig. 2)in which a linear  arrangement holds the water molecules apartwaterFig. 2Water also has a relatively high melting and boiling points than the ones it would have had with normal London forces.

Though CFCs have many beneficial uses, they also have devastating effects on the ozone layer:CFCs absorb a lot of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.The CFCs are then broken down by the UV light causing the formation of chlorine radicals.These radical react with ozone and break down the ozone layer:Other radicalsCFCs are not the only radicals that catalyse the breakdown of the ozone. One of the other sets of radicals linked to ozone breakdown are the nitrogen oxide radicals which can be formed:Naturally during lightning strikesAs a result of air travel in the stratosphereNitrogen

Though CFCs have many beneficial uses, they also have devastating effects on the ozone layer:CFCs absorb a lot of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.The CFCs are then broken down by the UV light causing the formation of chlorine radicals.These radical react with ozone and break down the ozone layer:Other radicalsCFCs are not the only radicals that catalyse the breakdown of the ozone. One of the other sets of radicals linked to ozone breakdown are the nitrogen oxide radicals which can be formed:Naturally during lightning strikesAs a result of air travel in the stratosphereNitrogen monoxide is formed by the direct combination of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures inside a combustion engineThe nitrogen monoxide formed is a free radical as it has an odd number of electrons / unpaired electron.The nitrogen monoxide radical reacts with one molecule of ozone to form the nitrogen dioxide molecule."},{"route":"content/chemistry/year 1/Organic/Alcohols","title":"Alcohols","content":"EliminationAlcohols can also undergo dehydration to form alkenes.

material with a non-zero spin in the outer magnetic field  in the frequency  (called the NRM frequency). According to the laws of quantum mechanics, the energy of interaction of the magnetic nucleus of a chemical element (which has a magnetic moment ) with the outer magnetic field with the direction  it can only accept a few discrete values. If magnetic nuclei are subjected to a constant magnetic field  with a periodic magnetic field, whose energy corresponds with the difference between these discrete energy levels expressed in frequency units (, , where E - is energy of electromagnetic wave, V - Frequency of electromagnetic wave,  - Length of the electromagnetic wave. C - Speed of light, H - Planck's constant) then the magnetic nuclei (which have a personal magnetic moment ) start to travel from one discrete energetic level to another, absorbing energy (identical in frequency) periodic magnetic field.Electron spin -Looking at resonance\\[\\[physics/year 1/Circular motion]]Before discussing resonance we must first look at oscillation. \\[\\[physics/year 1/Circular motion| Oscillation]]  - repeating process of changing the state of a system near the point of centre of mass.  Oscillation are described with certain physical terms:Amplitude (A) - The maximum value of displacement from the normalPeriod (T) - The time for an object to complete one whole oscillation with the amplitude A. It is measured in seconds.  Where t - time of oscillation, n - number of oscillationsFrequency - Value equal to the inverse of T. Resonance in physics is the feedback of the oscillating system to the periodic interaction with outside, shown in synchronisation of the oscillations of the system with those of the outside interaction, which causes a sharp increase of amplitude of the system.  This way, the frequencyResonance frequency V - is the frequency of the outside force, equal to the personal frequency of oscillation of the system, with which the maximum amplitude A is achievedNon Zero SpinNucleus of a chemical element with a non zero spin. The nucleus can by simplified to by represented as a positively charged () electric ball, due to it having protons with the charge of +1. The charged ball spins along it own axis, due to the laws of electrodynamics, the rotation of the charge leads to a magnetic field, ei the magnetic moment of the nucleus , which is angled along the axis of rotation. If  is placed in the outer magnetic field with the charge , then the vector of  starts to precession, ei. rotate about the direction of the outside magnetic field spin.pngIt precesses in the same way if it is spun in a non-vertical way. In this case the the magnetic field acts as the gravity.There only exists just about hundred isotopes of different chemical elements whose nuclei have the magnetic momentum , which allows us to observe NRM. This  is usually observed in nuclei which have an odd amount of nucleons ei. an odd sum of protons and neutrons. For each of these magnetic nuclei there is a correlation between the strength of their magnetic strength   and the frequency of the procession of the magnetic field  called hydromagnetic correlation. Using these we can pick a frequency NMR  for which in the magnetic field  will specific nuclei will be observable.\\[Rest of page 6]Observing NRMIf a periodic magnetic field act on a non zero spin nucleus instead of a constant one the nucleus interacts with it, amplifying the magnetic moment , and the nucleus absorbs energy of the outer periodic magnetic field. However this will only happen under the condition of resonance, ei. that the frequency of presses ion and the frequency of the outer magnetic field. At the moment of resonance the absorption is amplified which gives a peak on the NMR graph.\\[Rest of page 7]RoughAtoms nuclei \"excite\" and spin faster, they then start slowing down at different rates. Once the frequency of spin matches the frequency of the outer periodic magnetic wave, resonance happens, amplifying the wavelength of the nuclei. This is detected and shows up as a peak on the graph. Due to a difference in spin due to chemical shift, different atom groups show up in different parts of the graph. Chemical spin is the interference of magnetic fields of different atomic groups, resulting in different rate of spin of the nuclei.Chemical Shift"}]
