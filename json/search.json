Once the electron leaves the atom it has positive energy in the form Kinetic Energy.ExcitationColliding electrons which have a lower energy than the ionisation energy can still cause the atom to absorb their energy without ionisation occurring. This causes the electrons to transition from a lower Energy Level to a higher one - called excitation.

We call the initial set the domain and the resulting set the range. For example:img/math/book-2/4.jpegA function is a specific type of mapping where every element in the domain goes to exactly one element in the range. This means that mappings are only functions if ther are one-to-one or many-to-one.For example,  isn't a function iof 0 is in the domain (since 0 wouldn't be mapped to anything). Similarly,  isn't a function even if we restrict the domain to positive numbers) since every element of the domain would be mapped to two things in the range (eg. ).Note that this means that whether something is or isn't a function can depend as much on the domain as it does on the algebraic rule being applied. This means that it is crucial that the domain of a function is specified as part of its definition.Note that if we graph a mapping we can see quickly whether it is a function; any vertical line must hit the graph exactly once for each x-value in the domain for the mapping to be a function.Example 2.3For each of the following mappings, state whether the mapping is one-to-one, many-to-one or one-to-many and state whether it represents a function.img/math/book-2/5.jpegSolution 2.3a) One-to-manyb) One-to-one; is a functionc) If 0 is excluded its a functiond) Many-to-one; is a function2.5 Composite FunctionsWe can combine functions to make new ones called composite functions.

When we start modelling objects as rigid bodies we need to also consider the moments on an object (the moment of a force is a measure of its 'turning ability'). To do this we need to know both the size of any forces that are acting on the object and also where the forces are applied. The moment of a force , the perpendicular distance from the pivot  to the line of action of . Note that this means that a force acting at the pivot generates no moment. We can also think of this moment formula as saying that moment = d, the distance to the pivot, the perpendicular part of the force. When several forces act on a body, the resultant moment is found by adding all the individual moments (keeping in mind whether they are acting in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction).Example 1.1Four forces act on a rod AB, as shown in the diagram below. Calculate the resultant moment on the rod around B, specifying its direction.Solution 1.1EquilibriumFor a rigid body to be in equilibrium, there must be both no resultant force on it in any direction and no resultant moment on it around any point. Questions about rigid bodies in equilibrium are often made easier by choosing sensible places to take moments around (and by considering whether to start by looking at the forces or the moments).Example 1.2The diagram shows a uniform rod, , of length  and weight , resting horizontally on two supports at  and , where  and .

This repeats, causing molecules to attract.

The molecules are held together by weak intermolecular forces, the atoms within molecules are held together by strong covalent bonds.Melting and boiling pointsSimple molecular have low melting and boiling temperatures as the weak intermolecular require little energy to break. When the simple molecular lattice is broken, only intermolecular forces break not the strong covalent bonds.SolubilityNon-polarSimple molecular compounds tend to be soluble in non-polar solvents. This is because when added to a non-polar solvent intermolecular forces form between its molecules and the solvent. Those interactions weaken the intermolecular forces in the simple molecular lattice, thus dissolving the compound.PolarSolubility depends on the strength of the dipole. Polar covalent substance may dissolve in polar solvent as the polar molecules attract to the polar solvent molecules. The process is similar to dissolving an ionic compound. These rules extend to liquids and gases as well. In some compounds such as  contain both polar  and non-polar  bonds and can thus dissolve in both polar and non-polar solvents.Electrical conductivityThere are no mobile charged particles in a simple molecular lattice and thus they are non-conductors of electricity.Hydrogen BondingA hydrogen bond is a special type of permanent dipole-dipole interaction. It can be found between molecules containing an electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons (O, H, F) or a hydrogen atom attached to an electronegative atom.A hydrogen bonds acts between a lone pair of electrons on an electronegative atom in one molecules and a hydrogen atom in a different molecule (Fig. 1). An hydrogen bond is denoted by a dashed line.hydrogen bondsFig. 1Hydrogen Bonds in WaterDue to having two lone pair on the oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, each water molecule can form four hydrogen bonds, forming an open tetrahedral lattice (Fig. 2)in which a linear  arrangement holds the water molecules apartwaterFig. 2Water also has a relatively high melting and boiling points than the ones it would have had with normal London forces. Without hydrogen bonds water would have a boiling point of about -75C.Hydrogen Bonds in DNAIn DNA A and T bases pair forming two hydrogen bonds and C and G pair forming three hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3)dnaFig. 3They only bond in that configuration due to the shapes of the bases. Both A and G are purine bases with two-ringed structures. While T and C are both pyrimidine bases with single-ringed structures.

Though CFCs have many beneficial uses, they also have devastating effects on the ozone layer:CFCs absorb a lot of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.The CFCs are then broken down by the UV light causing the formation of chlorine radicals.These radical react with ozone and break down the ozone layer:Other radicalsCFCs are not the only radicals that catalyse the breakdown of the ozone. One of the other sets of radicals linked to ozone breakdown are the nitrogen oxide radicals which can be formed:Naturally during lightning strikesAs a result of air travel in the stratosphereNitrogen monoxide is formed by the direct combination of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures inside a combustion engineThe nitrogen monoxide formed is a free radical as it has an odd number of electrons /

Sulfur can have a valency(amount of outer shell electron) of 2,4 and 6, this happens as the paired electrons in 3s and 3p move into the 3d orbital:energysulfurMultiple bondsDouble covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between two shared pairs of electrons, most common are:doubleTriple covalent bonds is the electrostatic attraction between three shared pairs of electrons, most common are:TripleDative Covalent BondsIn a dative covalent bonds the shared pair of electrons are supplied by one atom, the shared pair used to be a lone pair.Eg.dativeThe '->' in the second diagram represents that both electrons were given by nitrogen.An easy way to chek if the dot and cross diagram is correct is by adding up all the electrons in teh outer shells of all the ellements before and after.Average bond enthalpy (brief start)Average bond enthalpy () is the measurement of covalent bond strength, the larger the average bond enthalpy, the stronger the bond.Molecule StructureElectron pairs have the same charge and thus repel. Electron shells seek to be as far away from each-other as possible.Eg.  has 4  bonds, they are equal, and thus the shape is a tetrahedral with angles 109.5 between each bond.WedgesTo represent 3D shapes on paper wedges are used:Top is used to represent a bond in the plane on the paperMiddle is used to represent a bond coming out of the plane on the paperBottom is used to represent a bond going in the plane on the paperwedgesA lone pair is slightly closer to the center of an atom than a bonded pair, as it occupies more space. Thus it repels more strongly.Thus:bonded/bonded < bonded/lone < lone/loneMore examples:dGenerally, with each lone pair the angle decreases approximately by 2.5 degrees.If a molecule as multiple bonds (eg. ) each multiple bond is treated as a region. Thus in a  molecule the angles between bonds is 180 as the bonds are treated as . Another interesting molecule is dThe angle is 90 as the shape of the molecule is octohedral thus between eachother the angle beween electrons is 90"},{"route":"content/chemistry/Alcohols","title":"Alcohols","content":"EliminationAlcohols can also undergo dehydration to form alkenes.

According to the laws of quantum mechanics, the energy of interaction of the magnetic nucleus of a chemical element (which has a magnetic moment ) with the outer magnetic field with the direction  it can only accept a few discrete values. If magnetic nuclei are subjected to a constant magnetic field  with a periodic magnetic field, whose energy corresponds with the difference between these discrete energy levels expressed in frequency units (, , where E - is energy of electromagnetic wave, V - Frequency of electromagnetic wave,  - Length of the electromagnetic wave. C - Speed of light, H - Planck's constant) then the magnetic nuclei (which have a personal magnetic moment ) start to travel from one discrete energetic level to another, absorbing energy (identical in frequency) periodic magnetic field.Electron spin -Looking at resonance\\[\\[Circular motion]]Before discussing resonance we must first look at oscillation. \\[\\[Circular motion | Oscillation]]  - repeating process of changing the state of a system near the point of centre of mass.  Oscillation are described with certain physical terms:Amplitude (A) - The maximum value of displacement from the normalPeriod (T) - The time for an object to complete one whole oscillation with the amplitude A. It is measured in seconds.  Where t - time of oscillation, n - number of oscillationsFrequency - Value equal to the inverse of T. Resonance in physics is the feedback of the oscillating system to the periodic interaction with outside, shown in synchronisation of the oscillations of the system with those of the outside interaction, which causes a sharp increase of amplitude of the system.  This way, the frequencyResonance frequency V - is the frequency of the outside force, equal to the personal frequency of oscillation of the system, with which the maximum amplitude A is achievedNon Zero SpinNucleus of a chemical element with a non zero spin. The nucleus can by simplified to by represented as a positively charged () electric ball, due to it having protons with the charge of +1. The charged ball spins along it own axis, due to the laws of electrodynamics, the rotation of the charge leads to a magnetic field, ei the magnetic moment of the nucleus , which is angled along the axis of rotation. If  is placed in the outer magnetic field with the charge , then the vector of  starts to precession, ei. rotate about the direction of the outside magnetic field spin.pngIt precesses in the same way if it is spun in a non-vertical way. In this case the the magnetic field acts as the gravity.There only exists just about hundred isotopes of different chemical elements whose nuclei have the magnetic momentum , which allows us to observe NRM. This  is usually observed in nuclei which have an odd amount of nucleons ei. an odd sum of protons and neutrons. For each of these magnetic nuclei there is a correlation between the strength of their magnetic strength   and the frequency of the procession of the magnetic field  called hydromagnetic correlation. Using these we can pick a frequency NMR  for which in the magnetic field  will specific nuclei will be observable.\\[Rest of page 6]Observing NRMIf a periodic magnetic field act on a non zero spin nucleus instead of a constant one the nucleus interacts with it, amplifying the magnetic moment , and the nucleus absorbs energy of the outer periodic magnetic field. However this will only happen under the condition of resonance, ei. that the frequency of presses ion and the frequency of the outer magnetic field. At the moment of resonance the absorption is amplified which gives a peak on the NMR graph.\\[Rest of page 7]RoughAtoms nuclei \"excite\" and spin faster, they then start slowing down at different rates. Once the frequency of spin matches the frequency of the outer periodic magnetic wave, resonance happens, amplifying the wavelength of the nuclei. This is detected and shows up as a peak on the graph. Due to a difference in spin due to chemical shift, different atom groups show up in different parts of the graph. Chemical spin is the interference of magnetic fields of different atomic groups, resulting in different rate of spin of the nuclei.Chemical Shift"}]
