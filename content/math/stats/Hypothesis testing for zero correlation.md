title: Hypothesis Testing
---

We can use a hypothesis test to determine whether the PMCC, for a particular sample,
indicates that there is likely to be a linear relationship, or not, within the whole population.

Sample PMC - $r$
Whole population - $\rho$

To test whether or not the population PMCC, $\rho$, is either > or < zero, use a one-tailed test:

$$
H_0: \rho = 0
$$

$$
H_1: \rho > 0 \text{ or } \rho < 0
$$

or if testing if the population PMCC is â‰  zero, use a two-tailed test:

$$
H_0: \rho = 0
$$

$$
H_1: \rho \neq 0
$$

To determine the critical region for the test statistic $r$, the sample PMCC, we need to use the
table of critical values (in your formula booklet, page 41)
