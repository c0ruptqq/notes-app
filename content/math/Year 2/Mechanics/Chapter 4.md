# Rigid Bodies
## 1.1 Moments
In book one we mainly looked at forces on particles which meant that we could ignore the rotational effects of any forces. When we start modelling objects as rigid bodies we need to also consider the moments on an object (the moment of a force is a measure of its 'turning ability'). To do this we need to know both the size of any forces that are acting on the object and also where the forces are applied. The moment of a force $F = F d$, the perpendicular distance from the pivot $P$ to the line of action of $F$. Note that this means that a force acting at the pivot generates no moment. We can also think of this moment formula as saying that moment = d, the distance to the pivot, the perpendicular part of the force. When several forces act on a body, the resultant moment is found by adding all the individual moments (keeping in mind whether they are acting in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction).

#### Example 1.1
Four forces act on a rod AB, as shown in the diagram below. Calculate the resultant moment on the rod around B, specifying its direction.

## Equilibrium
For a rigid body to be in equilibrium, there must be both no resultant force on it in any direction and no resultant moment on it around any point. Questions about rigid bodies in equilibrium are often made easier by choosing sensible places to take moments around (and by considering whether to start by looking at the forces or the moments).
#### Example 1.2
The diagram shows a uniform rod, $AB$, of length $4 m$ and weight $15 N$, resting horizontally on two supports at $C$ and $D$, where $AC = 0.5 m$ and $BD = 1 m$. Calculate the magnitude of the reaction force at each of the supports.

#### Example 1.3
The base of a ladder, $A$, is standing on rough horizontal ground, with the top, $B$, leaning against a smooth vertical wall. The ladder is at an angle of $55^{\circ}$ to the horizontal. The ladder has length $10 m$ and mass $20 kg$. A man of mass $80 kg$ is standing on the ladder at a point, $C$. By modelling the ladder as a uniform rod and the man as a particle, find the distance $AC$, given that the magnitude of the frictional force at $A$ is $200 N$.

## 1.3 Centre of Mass
If a rod is uniform then this means that its centre of mass (the place where its weight acts) is in its centre. But if a rod is non-uniform then the weight may act at a different point along the rod. Note that you should assume that a rod is non-uniform unless explicitly told otherwise.

#### Example 1.4
A rod, $AB$, is$ 4 m$ long and has weight $20 N$. It rests horizontally on two supports at $C$ and $D$, where $AC = 0.5 m$ and $BD = 1 m$, as shown below. The magnitude of the reaction force at $C$ is three times the magnitude of the reaction force at $D$. Find the distance of the centre of mass from $A$.

## 1.4 Tilting
When a rod sits on two supports, if it is ‘on the point of tilting’ around one of them it means that the other support may as well not be there (ie. the reaction force at that other support is zero). The same logic can also be applied to a rod being held by two strings or wires.

#### Example 1.5
A uniform rod, $AB$, is $4 m$ long and has mass $45 kg$. It rests horizontally on two supports at $C$ and $D$, where $AC = 0.5 m$ and $BD = 1 m$, as shown below. When a mass, $m$ kg, is placed on the rod at $A$, the rod is on the point of tilting about $C$. Find the value of $m$.
