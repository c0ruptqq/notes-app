If the arc AB has length r, then $\angle AOB$ is 1 radian ($1^c$)
A full circle has an arc length $2\pi r$, so the angle around a full circle is $2\pi$ rad.

$$
\therefore 2\pi \text{ rad } = 360 => \pi \text{ rad } = 180 => 1 \text{ rad } = \frac {180} \pi
$$

## 5.2 Sector and segment Formulae
To find the arc length of a sector of angle $\theta$ we can use the formula $l=r\theta$. The area of a sector of angle $\theta$ can be found using $A = \frac 1 2 r^2(\theta - \sin \theta)$

## 5.4 Small Angle Approximations
When $\theta$ is small and measured in radians:

$$
\sin \theta \approx \theta
$$
$$
\tan \theta \approx \theta
$$
$$
\cos \theta \approx 1-\frac {\theta^2} 2
$$

All of these are given in the formula book.
