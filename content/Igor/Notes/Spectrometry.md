NMR spectrometry is a resonance absorption of electro magnetic energy by a material with a non-zero spin in the outer magnetic field $\vec{B_{0}}$ in the frequency $\mu$ (called the NRM frequency). According to the laws of quantum mechanics, the energy of interaction of the magnetic nucleus of a chemical element (which has a magnetic moment $\mu$) with the outer magnetic field with the direction $\vec{B_{0}}$ it can only accept a few discrete values. If magnetic nuclei are subjected to a constant magnetic field $\vec{B_{0}}$ with a periodic magnetic field, whose energy corresponds with the difference between these discrete energy levels expressed in frequency units ($E=H\times v$, $V \times \lambda = C$, where E - is energy of electromagnetic wave, V - Frequency of electromagnetic wave, $\lambda$ - Length of the electromagnetic wave. C - Speed of light, H - Planck's constant) then the magnetic nuclei (which have a personal magnetic moment $\mu$) start to travel from one discrete energetic level to another, absorbing energy (identical in frequency) periodic magnetic field.

### Looking at resonance
[[physics/year 1/Circular motion]]
Before discussing resonance we must first look at oscillation. [[physics/year 1/Circular motion| Oscillation]]  - repeating process of changing the state of a system near the point of centre of mass.  Oscillation are described with certain physical terms:
- Amplitude (A) - The maximum value of displacement from the normal 
- Period (T) - The time for an object to complete one whole oscillation with the amplitude A. It is measured in seconds. $T=\frac{t}{n}$ Where t - time of oscillation, n - number of oscillations
- Frequency - Value equal to the inverse of T. $F = \frac{1}{T}$

Resonance in physics is the feedback of the oscillating system to the periodic interaction with outside, shown in synchronisation of the oscillations of the system with those of the outside interaction, which causes a sharp increase of amplitude of the system.  This way, the frequency 

- Resonance frequency V - is the frequency of the outside force, equal to the personal frequency of oscillation of the system, with which the maximum amplitude A is achieved


## Non Zero Spin
**Nucleus of a chemical element with a non zero spin.** The nucleus can by simplified to by represented as a positively charged ($Z+$) electric ball, due to it having protons with the charge of +1. The charged ball spins along it own axis, due to the laws of electrodynamics, the rotation of the charge leads to a magnetic field, ei the magnetic moment of the nucleus $\mu$, which is angled along the axis of rotation. If $\mu$ is placed in the outer magnetic field with the charge $\vec{B_{0}}$, then the vector of $\vec{\mu}$ starts to precession, ei. rotate about the direction of the outside magnetic field $\vec{B_{0}}$

It precesses in the same way if it is spun in a non-vertical way. In this case the the magnetic field acts as the gravity.

There only exists just about hundred isotopes of different chemical elements whose nuclei have the magnetic momentum $\mu$, which allows us to observe NRM. This  is usually observed in nuclei which have an odd amount of nucleons ei. an odd sum of protons and neutrons. For each of these magnetic nuclei there is a correlation between the strength of their magnetic strength  $\vec{B_{0}}$ and the frequency of the procession of the magnetic field $\mu$ called hydromagnetic correlation. Using these we can pick a frequency NMR $\mu$ for which in the magnetic field $\vec{B_{0}}$ will specific nuclei will be observable.

## Observing NRM
If a periodic magnetic field act on a non zero spin nucleus instead of a constant one the nucleus interacts with it, amplifying the magnetic moment $\vec{\mu}$, and the nucleus absorbs energy of the outer periodic magnetic field. However this will only happen under the condition of resonance, ei. that the frequency of presses ion and the frequency of the outer magnetic field. At the moment of resonance the absorption is amplified which gives a peak on the NMR graph.

## Rough
Atoms nuclei "excite" and spin faster, they then start slowing down at different rates. Once the frequency of spin matches the frequency of the outer periodic magnetic wave, resonance happens, amplifying the wavelength of the nuclei. This is detected and shows up as a peak on the graph. Due to a difference in spin due to chemical shift, different atom groups show up in different parts of the graph. Chemical spin is the interference of magnetic fields of different atomic groups, resulting in different rate of spin of the nuclei.
