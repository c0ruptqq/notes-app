# Particles
## Beta decay
### Beta Negative

Beta decays occurs when a nucleus releases a beta negative ($\beta^-$) particle and an antineutrino ($\bar{v}$).

- $\beta$ is an electron
- $\bar{v}$ is the antimatter equivalent to the neutrino
- During the process one of the neutron changes into a proton

Eg.

$$
\ce{^{60}_{27} Co -> ^{60}_{28} Bi + ^{0}_{-1} \beta^{-} + ^{0}_{0}\bar{V_e}}
$$

### Beta Positive
- Nucleus releases a beta positive $\beta^+$ and a neutrino $v$ 
- $\beta^+$ comprises of a positron.
- Positron if the antimatter counterpart to the electron

Eg. 

$$
\ce{^{10}_{6} C -> ^{10}_{5} B + ^{0}_{1} \beta^+ + ^{0}_{0} V_e}
$$

## Antiparticles
Every type of particle is associated with an antiparticle with the same mass but opposite charge.

| Particle | Antiparticle |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Proton   | Anitproton   |
| Neutron  | Antineutron  |
| Electron | Positron     |
| Neutrino | Antineutrino |

### Antimatter
Antimatter consists of elementary particles which are antiparticles of those that make up normal matter. It has the same mass but a different charge.

## $E = mc^2$
- Mass increases as its speed increases
- The more energy a particle has the more mass it has
- E - Energy
- m - mass
- c - speed of light

$$
E = mc^2
$$

The mass of a particle at rest is $m_0$ (rest mass) which corresponds to $E_0$ (rest energy)

$$
\therefore E_0 = m_0c^2
$$

When given energy:

$$
E = m_0c^2 + E_k
$$

## Annihilation
- When a particle and a anti-particle meet, they annihilate and produce energy
- Energy is produced because the annihilation event unlocks the rest energy ($E_0$) of **both** particles, so their energies are released.

$$
2hfmin = 2E_0
$$

**Two** photons used to be produced to **conserve momentum**

## Creation: pair production
 A photon with sufficient energy passing near a nucleus or electron can suddenly charge into a particle-antiparticle pair which separate from one another.

$$
hf_{min} = 2E_0
$$

## Neutrino
A subatomic particle, similar to the electron, with smaller mass (might even be zero) and no charge. They have a very minor interactions with matter and are difficult to defeat.

## Units
The following is a small unit of charge suitable for discussing particles:

$$
1eV
$$

Where: 
- e - Charge of electron
- V - Voltage

This is how much energy a particle of charge $e$ has when accelerated by a $1V$ potential difference.

$$
1eV = 1.61*10^{-19}J
$$

$$
1J = 1.61*10^{19}eV
$$

## Energy Distributions
![23.png](/img/phys/23.png)

When a particle interaction takes place and particles are produced, the collection
of particles produced have the same total energy, BUT each particle alone can have a
random different amount of energy that must add up to the total. This is why no particles are detected at $1.2 MeV$. 

## Particle Interactions

### 2 Protons in close proximity
When two protons approach each other they repel. 

Interactions between particles occur through the exchange of virtual (messenger) particle. They are virtual as we cannot detect them. If we observed them it would prevent the Force from occurring. In the case of two protons there is an exchange of a virtual photon. The Feynman Diagram is used to represent this.

### W-Boson

- Mediates the weak nuclear force interactions
- Have a non-zero rest mass
- Has a short range of 0.001 fm

## Electron Capture

A proton in a proton rich nucleus can turn into a neutron as a result of interacting through the weak interaction with an inner-shell electron from another nucleus. 

![28.png](/img/phys/28.png)

This can occur when a proton and electron collide.

## Decay Modes

During the decay process the particles undergo decay modes:
- Kaon decays into pions (if $K^0$) or muon and an antineutrino (if $K^-$) or antimuon and a neutrino (if $K^+$)
- Charged pion decays into a muon and an antineutrino (if $\pi^+$) or an antimuon and a neutrino (if $\pi^-$)
- Neutral pion ($\pi$) decays into photons
- Muon ($\mu^-$) decays into an electron and a antineutrino
- Antimuon ($\mu^+$) decays into a positron and a [[physics/year 1/neutrino]]

## [[physics/year 1/Hadron]] production

A electron-positron annihilation event produces a quark and a antiquark, moving in the opposite direction. They also produce a shower of hadrons. This is possible due to the conservation of energy. If there is enough energy, it is possible.

## Conservation Rules

Both charge and energy must be conserved before and after an interaction

### Lepton Number
- Leptons change into other leptons through the weak interaction. 
- The Lepton Number is always conserved in any particle interaction


| Lepton Number | Particle Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| +1            | Lepton        |
| -1            | Antilepton    |
| 0             | Non-lepton    |

### Baryon number

Same as Lepton number

| Baryon Number | Particle Type |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| +1            | Baryon        |
| -1            | Antibaryon    |
| 0             | Non-baryon    |

### Strangeness

Kaon is a strange particle. Strangeness is always conserved if the interaction is mediated by a Strong or Electromagnetic interaction. Strangeness does not necessarily need to be conserved by the weak interaction.
