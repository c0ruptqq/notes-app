<!--ID: 1724603671324-->


Photo electric effect equation:

$$
E_{Kmax} = hf - \phi
$$

- The work function $\phi$ is considered to be the minimum energy needed by a conduction electron to escape the material surface, when the material is at zero potential.

Emission of an electron from the metal surface will only take place if $E_{Kmax} > 0$ or if $hf > \phi$

By considering $E_{Kmax} = 0$ when the electron has exactly the right amount of energy to overcome the work function but no kinetic energy:

$$
f_{min}  = \frac {\phi} h
$$

$$
E_{Kmax} = eV_s
$$

Where $V_s$ is the stopping potential

Millikan's experiment can be plotted:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

$$
E_{Kmax} = hf + (-\phi)
$$

## Electron energy levels

As mentioned in [[chemistry/year 1/Electron_Structure|Electron_Structure]] electrons exist in energy levels. As processes within the atom occur, electrons are able to transition between energy levels depending on their energies. n=1 is the lowest possible energy an electron can have - the ground state energy.

The energies are negative, as the electrons "owe" the atom energy to leave the atom.

## Ionisation

Energy levels can be used to understand ionisation. high energy electron colliding with an atom can cause the ejection of an inner shell electron from an atom causing what is called ionisation. If $n = \infty$ it is ionised. $\therefore$ $n=1 -> n=\infty$ is ionisation energy. Once the electron leaves the atom it has positive energy in the form Kinetic Energy.

## Excitation
Colliding electrons which have a lower energy than the ionisation energy can still cause the atom to absorb their energy without ionisation occurring. This causes the electrons to transition from a lower Energy Level to a higher one - called excitation. Random perturbations in vacuum often cause electrons to fall back down to a lower energy level, causing a photon to be released. The energy of the photon is the same as the change in energy of the Energy levels.

$\lambda = \frac {hc} {E}$
