title: Simple Harmonic Motion
---
Definition: A system is undergoing SHM is we are able to show that the system satisfies the following condition:
- Acceleration of a system is proportional to the **negative** displacement of that object

$$
a \propto -x
$$

If we have a particle going around a circle where the centre of the circle is the origin O and radius $r$ it can be described as such:
- $x=r\cos \theta$
- $y=r\sin \theta$
When the particle is in motion it is in circular motion, therefore it experiences centripetal acceleration towards the centre of the circle. As the acceleration acts towards the centre of the circle it is negative in relation to the coordinate system.  
$$
\therefore a = -\omega ^2 r$$ and 
$$
a =a_{x}i+a_{y}j
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}a_{x}&=|a|\cos \theta \\ a_{x}&=-\omega ^2r\cos \theta \\ a_{x} &= -\omega ^2x
\end{aligned}
$$

## Mass Spring System

When stationary: $F_{s}=mg$
When pulled down: $F_{s}=mg+F_{\text{pull}}$
At $F_{ \text{pull}}=0$ aka when let go
The weight will accelerate upwards as $F_{s}>mg$
The further the object goes from its equilibrium position the bigger the magnitude of the $F_{s}$

$$
\begin{aligned}F_{s}&=-kx \text{ and } W=mg \\ a&= \frac{F_{s}}{m} \\ &=-\frac{kx}{m} \implies \text{where 'k' is the spring constant}\end{aligned} \\ (1)
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}\omega &=2\pi f \\\omega ^2 &= 4\pi^2f^2 \\ 4\pi^2f^2 &=\frac{k}{m} \\ f^2&=\frac{1}{4\pi^4}\times \frac{m}{k} \\ f&=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{ \frac{k}{m} } \\T&=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{m}{k} }\end{aligned}
$$

This is the time period of the mass oscillator system, this is a mechanism used in watches as it is independent of gravity as shown in (1).
