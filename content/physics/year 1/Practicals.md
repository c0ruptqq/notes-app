- After finding values, evaluate their meaning.
- If the true value is the extreme case (max value) there is a systematic error which **needs** to be explained
- Consider uncertainties appropriately (if the line of best fit doesn't include the error bars, most likely it is wrong)
- Error bars need to be symmetric around their centre point
- There should be at least 3 hazards which are genuine (serious damage)
- Significant figures need to match, (errors will most likely be one decimal figure)
- **Line of best fit needs to hit all points and error bars**
