# Refraction
<!--ID: 1724603671318-->


GCSE: Bending of light when there is a change in medium
A-Level: Change in speed of a wave due to a change in medium or due to variations in properties of a medium.

Refraction occurs for all types of waves including light and sound.

## Light 
For light waves we need to consider the optical property of the medium, the refractive index ($n$)

$$
n = \frac c {c_s}
$$

where:
- $c$ is the speed of light in empty space
- $n$ is the refractive index, it has no unit as it is a ratio
- $c_s$ speed of light in the medium
In general, $c_s \leq c$ and $n = \frac c {c_s} \geq 1$ 



### Relationship between $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ (angles of incidence and reflection)

$n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2$ (Snell's law - light version)

$$
\frac {\sin\theta_1} {\sin\theta_2} = \frac {n_2} {n_1}
$$

$$
n = \frac c n
$$
$$
\therefore \frac {n_2} {n_1} = \frac {\frac {c} {v_2}} {\frac {c} {v_1}} = \frac {v_1} {v_2}
$$

Also:

$$
\begin{aligned} v_1 & = \lambda_1f_1  \\ v_2 & = \lambda_2f_2 \end{aligned}
$$

$$
\frac {v_1} {v_2} = \frac {\lambda_1} {\lambda_2}
$$

note: frequency is unchanged during refraction 

$\therefore$ Snells' Law: 

$$
\frac {\sin\theta_1} {\sin\theta_2} = \frac {n_2} {n_1} = \frac {v_1} {v_2} = \frac {\lambda_1} {\lambda_2}
$$

If wave speed increases: v $\uparrow$; f const; $\lambda \uparrow$; n $\downarrow$
If wave speed decreases: v $\downarrow$; f const; $\lambda \downarrow$; n $\uparrow$

### Total internal reflection (TIR)

Can only occur when the ray is speeding up.
Ray speeding up:
- $n_2 < n_1$
- $v_1 > v_2$
- $\theta_2 > \theta_1$

$\theta_1 = \theta_c$
$\theta_2 = 90$

If $\theta_1 > \theta_c$ then $\theta_2 > 90 \therefore$ the ray is reflected

$$
\begin{aligned} n_1\sin\theta_c & = n_2\sin90 \\ \sin\theta_c &= \frac {n_2} {n_1}\end{aligned}
$$
