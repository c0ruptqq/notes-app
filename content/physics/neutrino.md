title: Neutrino
---
Neutrinos travel close to the speed of light. They can be observed in:
- Beta decay
- Muon decay

- $V_e$ - Electron neutrinos are created specifically with an electron, they have a mass < $2.2eV$
- $V_{\mu}$ - Muon neutrinos - created specifically with a muon, they have a mass < $170KeV$
