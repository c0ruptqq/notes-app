# Glossary
Amplitude (A) - Maximum displacement of the oscillating object from the equilibrium 
Time period (T) - The time to complete one full oscillation cycle by the object (s)
Frequency (f) - Number of cycles per second by the oscillating object (Hz)
Angular frequency ($\omega$) - Angular speed ($rad \text{ }s^{-1}$)
Acceleration (a)
Displacement (x)
Spring constant (k)
Phase angle ($\phi$) - Determined by the starting conditions (rad)
# Equations
$$
F = -kx
$$
$$
T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{2\pi}{\omega}
$$
$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = \sqrt{ \frac{k}{m} }
$$
$$
\text{Phase difference (rad)} = \frac{2\pi \Delta t}{T} \text{ }
$$
Where $\Delta t$ is the time difference between the two oscillating objects
$$
a = -\omega^2x
$$
$$
v=\pm \omega \sqrt{ (A^2-X^2) }
$$
$$
\text{Spring system: } T= 2\pi\sqrt{ \frac{m}{k} }
$$
$$
\text{Pendulum system: } T=2\pi \sqrt{ \frac{l}{g} }
$$
$$
x=A\cos(\omega t + \phi)
$$
$$
v= \dot{x} = -\omega A \sin(\omega t+\phi)
$$
$$
a = \ddot{x} =-\omega ^2\cos(\omega t+\phi)
$$
# Simple Harmonic Motion
An object is experiencing simple harmonic motion if it is oscillating in a way in which acceleration:
- Proportional to the displacement
- Always in the opposite direction to displacement


$$
a \propto-x
$$
## Spring System
<mark class="hltr-purple">The period of oscillation is independent of the initial displacement</mark>

The constants $\phi$ and A are determined by the starting conditions of the oscillation, ei. starting velocity and displacement

## Damping
The forces that cause the oscillations to decrease are *dissipative* forces. If dissipative forces are present the motion is *damped*. There are three damping types:
- Light damping - When the time period is independent of the amplitude so each cycle takes the same length of time as the oscillations die away. 
- Critical damping - Just enough to stop the system oscillating after it had been displaced. The system returns to the equilibrium in the shortest possible time without overshooting if set up correctly (eg. car suspension).
- Heavy damping - When the damping is so strong that the displaced object returns to equilibrium much more slowly than is the system is critically damped (eg. spring system in thick oil).
