### Gas chromatography
Gas chromatography is used to separate a mixture of volatile liquids. Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GLC) is used for analysing:
- Gases
- Volatile liquids
- Solids in their vapour form

The stationary phase: A long coiled column with a non-volatile liquid that is adsorbed onto an inert solid support.


The mobile phase: An inert carrier gas (e.g. helium, neon or nitrogen).

Adsorbed - Temporarily attracted to the element

- The sample is injected into the column.
- It is vaporised and carried through the stationary phase using the inert-gas mobile phase.
-  The components of the mixture that are more attracted to the stationary phase, move slower.
- The component that comes out first is least attracted to the solid stationary phase.
- Times taken for each component to leave the column are recorded, these are called retention times.
- The components of the mixture are identified by comparing their retention times with a database.
- The relative size of the peak (peak integrations) relates to the concentration of substances within the mixture.

**Uses**:
- Identify the level of alcohol in blood or urine.
- Detecting small concentrations of substances, for example environmental pollutants or caffeine concentrations. 
- Drugs in urine.

Doping can occur in sports, athletes and horses are regularly tested for drugs by analysing their urine.

### Thin-Layer Chromatography: 
Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) is a technique used to analyse small samples via separation. For example, we could separate a dye out to determine the mixture of dyes in a forensic sample.

Stationary phase:
- This phase is commonly a thin metal sheet coated in alumina ($\ce{Al2O3}$) or silica ($\ce{SiO2}$). 
- The solute molecules adsorb onto the surface.
- The more the substances are attracted to the stationary phase, the slower they will travel up the chromatogram.

Mobile phase:
- Flows over the stationary phase.
- It is a polar or non-polar liquid (solvent) that carries components of the compound being investigated.
- Polar solvents - water or alcohol.
- Non-polar solvents - alkanes.
- If the sample components are coloured, their spots are easily identifiable on the chromatogram.
- If the sample components are not coloured, then we can locate the spots on the chromatogram and draw around them in pencil.

To locate the spots we can use:
- UV light
- Ninhydrin (carcinogenic)
- Iodine vapour

#### Analysis of TLC chromatograms:

The less polar components travel further up the TLC plate.
Their Rf values are higher than those closer to the baseline.
They are more soluble in the mobile phase and get carried forwards with the solvent.

More polar components do not travel far up the plate.
They are more attracted to the polar stationary phase.

The extent of separating molecules in the investigated sample depends on the solubility in the mobile and stationary phases.

Knowing the Rf values, of compounds being analysed, helps to compare the polarity of various molecules.
