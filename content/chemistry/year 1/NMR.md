<!--ID: 1724603671381-->


The horizontal scale on an NMR spectrum represents chemical shift (δ). Chemical shift is measured in parts per million (ppm) of the radio frequency needed for resonance compared to a reference chemical called tetramethylsilane (TMS). TMS is used universally as the reference compound for NMR because: its methyl groups are particularly well shielded and so it produces a strong, single peak at the far right of an NMR spectrum. The signal from the hydrogen atoms in TMS is defined as having a chemical shift of 0 ppm.

TMS is a good reference as:
- Low boiling point so it is easy to remove.
- Gives 1 single, intense signal that resonates upfield from others.
- Non-toxic
- Inert

## Carbon NMR
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used for analysing organic compounds.
Atoms with odd mass numbers usually show signals on NMR. Many of the carbon atoms on organic molecules are carbon-12. A small quantity of organic molecules will contain the isotope carbon-13 atoms. These will show signals on a 13C NMR. In 13C NMR, the magnetic field strengths of carbon-13 atoms in organic compounds are measured and recorded on a spectrum.
All samples are measured against a reference compound – Tetramethylsilane (TMS). On a 13C NMR spectrum, non-equivalent carbon atoms appear as peaks with different chemical shifts.


### Features of a 13C NMR spectrum
13C NMR spectrum displays sharp single signals.
The height of each signal is not proportional to the number of carbon atoms present in a single molecular environment. Carbon atoms in different chemical environments will give resonances at different chemical shifts in a 13C spectrum. 
- Each signal indicates carbon atoms with the same molecular environment.
- Signals with higher shift values are due to carbon atoms which are closer to electronegative elements, such as oxygen.

#### For example propanone
There are 2 molecular environments. 2 signals will be present on its 13C NMR spectrum.

### Solvents
NMR spectra are recorded in solution.
The sample is dissolved in a proton free solvent to avoid unwanted absorptions.
- For polar substances $\ce{CDCl3}$ would be used.
- For non-polar substances $\ce{CCl4}$ would be used.
In 13C NMR there would be a peak due to the solvent but at A-level it is usually removed from the spectrum.


## Counting Peaks
The amount of peaks depends on two things, the neighbouring carbon environment and the distance from oxygen (or a similar electronegative atom, Eg. Group 7).

## Summary
### TMS
Tms is used as a reference in graphs, it always shows up as a 0 peak on the graph. $\ce{C_{4}H_{12}Si}$. 
### Solvents
Solvents can e polar and non polar. For polar substances a polar solution is used, $\ce{CDCl_{3}}$. For non-polar substance a non-polar solvent is used, $\ce{CCl_{4}}$
### C-NMR
Counting the number of carbon peaks:
- Count the number of different Carbon environments. Two things affect this, the neighbouring carbon environments and the distance from an electronegative atom (usually oxygen). 
### H-NMR
Counting the number of hydrogen peaks:
- It is the same as carbon, however, only carbons with hydrogens are counted.
