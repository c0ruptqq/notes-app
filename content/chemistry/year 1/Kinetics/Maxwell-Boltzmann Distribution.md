- Peak is the most probable energy of molecules
- It starts at zero as when there are no molecules the energy is zero
- The right end of the curve doesn't touch the graph as the graph is a probability curve we can never assume that its zero
- The area under the graph is the total number the molecules in the system
- When drawing **do not** make the curve touch the x-axis and it **must** start at zero 

## Temperature

Temperature increase:
- Increasing temperature means that molecules will *on average* have more kinetic energy [[chemistry/year 1/Kinetics/Kinetics|Kinetics]]
- Therefore they will move faster 
- Greater proportion of molecules will have the activation energy
- Particles will collide more often
- They will result in an increased rate of reaction
- The number of particles remains the same so the area under the curve must be the same
## Catalysts

As a catalyst lowers the activation energy, on the graph it moves the activation energy to the left, ergo increasing the area of reaction particles.
