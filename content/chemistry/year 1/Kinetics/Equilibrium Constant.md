# Equilibrium Constant

The equilibrium constant - ratio of the concentrations of products and reactants:


$$
\ce{aA + bB <=> cC + dD}
$$

$$
K_c = \frac {\text{[products]}} {\text{[reactants]}} = \frac {[C]^c[D]^d} {[B]^b[A]^a}
$$

$K_c$ doesn't have a unit inherently, however in each equation after simplification the units become apparent. The units give a mark in an exam. The value of $K_c$ is **only** affected by temperature. If $K_c$ has units all the values need to be in concentration. When equilibrium is disrupted in a reaction, once the system regains equilibrium the value of $K_{c}$ will be the same as before. The **only factor** that affects $K_{c}$ is temperature. In an exothermic reaction if the temperature increases, $K_{c}$ will decrease. If the reaction is endothermic, $K_{c}$ will increase, this can be shown through the [[notes/chemistry/Kinetics/Equilibrium|Le Chatelier's Principle]].
