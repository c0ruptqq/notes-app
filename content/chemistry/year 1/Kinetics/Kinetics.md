Factors that affect the rate of reaction:
- Concentration 
- Pressure
- Temperature
- Particle size (surface area)
- Catalysts
<!--ID: 1724603671385-->


For a reaction to take place:
- Particles need to collide 
- The collision needs to be in the correct orientation
- And collision needs to occur with enough energy
## Effective Collision
An effective collision is one that has the minimum required energy and the correct orientation
#### Orientation

#### Concentration
- Frequency of collisions (per unit of time) increases
- Chance of effective collision increase (correct orientation)
- $\therefore$ Reaction rate increases

#### Temperature
- Frequency of collisions **and** energy of each collision increases ($K_e$ is increased)
- Both cause chance of an effective collision to increase

## Rates of reaction

Rate of reaction - The change of concentration of ANY reactant or product with unit time.
Units are often vol/time Eg. $cm^3s^{-1}$

Or

Concentration/time Eg. $mol dm^{-3}s^{-1}$

Different ways to measure rate of reaction:
- Measuring volumes of gases evolved
- Measuring mass changes
- pH measurement
- Colorimetry (Ion colourless, compounds are coloured )
- Titration (For this method aliquots of reaction mixture are taken and "quenched" at various times and analysed for by titration for the concentration of products or reactants.) (eg. add a base to an acidic solution to stop the reaction)

Aliquot - small sample
Quenched - stop

Calculating rate at a certain point on a graph:
- Take a tangent to the point
- Measure the change in concentration and time of the straight line
- Use those values to calculate the rate of the reaction

[Include graphs for each effects (temp, concentration, particle size)]

## Catalysts

Heterogeneous - Catalysts that are in a different phase to reactants. These can be quite practical as to retrieve them the could be filtered
Homogeneous - Catalysts that are in the same phase as the reactants such as (aq)

Phase - State

$$
\ce{CH3COOH_{(aq)} + CH3OH_{(aq)} + H+_{(aq)} -> CH3COOH3 _{(aq)} + H2O_{(l)} + H+_{(aq)}}
$$

Catalysts can reduce energy costs in industrial processes.

### Heterogeneous

An example is where two reactant (gas) both sit on a catalyst (solid) and react:
1) One of the reactants approaches the catalyst's surface and settles onto tan active site - **Absorption**
2) Another reactant approaches the catalyst
3) Re-arrangement of electrons takes place - **Reaction**
4) The products are released from the surface - **Desorption**

Solid heterogenous catalysts can be designed to maximise surface area: such as a honeycomb structure

Catalytic convertors are present in combustion engines of cars

They convert polluting gases to less harmful products:

$$
\ce{NO + CO -> CO2 + N2}
$$

The platinum catalyst itself is coated on a ceramic support constructed in a honeycomb motif.
