## Elimination
Alcohols can also undergo dehydration to form alkenes. This is an example of an elimination reaction. Elimination reactions involve a small molecule leaving the parent molecule as a by-product. In this case,the small molecule is a water molecule. The water molecule is formed from the -OH group and a hydrogen atom from the adjacent carbon atom.

  

Alcohol is heated under reflux in the presence of concentrated sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid.

## Substitution
In the substitution of alcohols, a hydroxyl group (-OH) is replaced by a halogen to form a haloalkane.Â  The alcohol is heated under reflux with sulfuric acid and a sodium halide, the HBr is formed as part of the reaction.

To make 2-bromopropane from propan-2-ol:

Step 1:
$$
\ce{NaBr + H2SO4 -> HBr + NaHSO4}
$$

Step 2:

$$
\ce{HBr + CH3CH(OH)CH3 -> CH3CH(Br)CH3 + H2O}
$$

Overall reaction:

$$
\ce{NaBr + H2SO4 + CH3CH(OH)Ch3 -> CH3CH(Br)CH3 + H2O + NaHSO4}
$$
