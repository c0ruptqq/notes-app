| Rate of hydrolysis (due to bond enthalpy) | C-F (very very slow)<br>C-Cl (very slow)<br>C-Br (slow)<br>C-I (very fast)<br>(this is due to the size of the atoms ie. the bond on the Iodine is much further from the nucleus than on the Flourine) |
Halogenoalkanes are generally insoluble in water, there would be an organic layer of the halogenoalkane and an aqueous layer of sodium hydroxide. Any reaction would only occur where the two layers meet. A nucleophilic substitution reaction i one in which a nucleophile attacks a carbon atom which carries a partial positive charge. An atom that has a partial negative charge is replaced by the nucleophile.

## Measuring the rate of hydrolysis

Acidified silver nitrate can be used to measure the rate of hydrolysis of halogenoalkanes.

| Halogenoalkane | Precipitate                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Chlorides      | White (silver chloride)     |
| Bromides       | Cream (silver bromide)      |
| Iodides        | Pale yellow (silver iodide) |

The yellow precipitate will form the fastest. This is because the C-I bond has the lowest bond enthalpy, so it is the easiest to break and will cause the I- ions to form the fastest. The white precipitate will form the slowest. This is because the C-Cl bond has the highest bond enthalpy, so it is the hardest to break and will cause the Cl- ions to form the slowest. During substitution reactions the C-I bond will therefore heterolytically break as follows:

$$
\ce{R\bond{-}C\bond{-}I + OH- -> R\bond{-}C\bond{-}OH + I-}
$$

## Breakdown Of the Ozone Layer

The most common halogenoalkanes are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFCs have many uses due to their chemical inertness as they are non-flammable and non-toxic.
- They are used as refrigerators.
- Propellants for aerosols.
- As solvents for dry cleaning.

### Fluoro Halogenoalkanes

| Use                   | Examples of compounds                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| General Solvents      | $\ce{CHCl3}$                                    |
| Dry cleaning solvents | $\ce{C2H2Cl2}$<br><br>$\ce{C2HCl3}$             |
| Making polymers       | $\ce{C2H3Cl}$<br>$\ce{C2F4}$                    |
| Flame retardants      | $\ce{CF3Br}$                                    |
| Refrigerants          | $\ce{F2CCl2}$<br>$\ce{HCClF2}$<br>$\ce{HCCl2F}$ |

### Hydrofluorocrabons

Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are compounds that contain a carbon attached to hydrogen and fluorine atoms only. e.g.CH2F-CF3. HFCs are chemically inert and are therefore used for a wide range of purposes. Though CFCs have many beneficial uses, they also have devastating effects on the ozone layer:
- CFCs absorb a lot of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere.
- The CFCs are then broken down by the UV light causing the formation of chlorine radicals.

These radical react with ozone and break down the ozone layer:

$$
\ce{Cl^. + O3 -> ClO^. + O2}
$$

$$
\ce{ClO^. + O3 -> 2O2 + Cl^.}
$$

$$
\therefore \ce{2O3 -> 3O2}
$$

### Other radicals


CFCs are not the only radicals that catalyse the breakdown of the ozone. One of the other sets of radicals linked to ozone breakdown are the nitrogen oxide radicals which can be formed:

- Naturally during lightning strikes
- As a result of air travel in the stratosphere
- Nitrogen monoxide is formed by the direct combination of nitrogen and oxygen at high temperatures inside a combustion engine
  
The nitrogen monoxide formed is a free radical as it has an odd number of electrons / unpaired electron.
The nitrogen monoxide radical reacts with one molecule of ozone to form the nitrogen dioxide molecule.

$$
\ce{NO^. + O3 -> NO2^. + O2}
$$

$$
\ce{NO2^. + O -> NO^. + O2}
$$

$$
\ce{O3 + O -> 2O2}
$$
