title: Equilibrium

Equilibrium is the state of balance in which nothing changes. This is know as dynamic equilibrium. 

$$\ce{A + B <=> C + D}$$

- At the start of the reaction the reaction will be going to the right
- As the concentration of A and B decreases, the forward rate of reaction decreases
- As the concentration of C and D increase the rate of the backwards reaction increases
- This will continue to happen until the rate of the forwards and backwards reaction reach the same rate

Notes on Equilibrium:
- Forwards and backwards reaction are going at the same rate
- The concentrations of reactants and products remain constant
- Equilibrium will only be reached in a closed system
- The concentrations of products and reactants do not have to be the same

## Le Chatelier's Principle

> If a system at equilibrium is disturbed, the equilibrium move in the direction that tends to reduce the disturbance - Le Chatelier 

If any factor is changed the system will try to oppose this change. If the temperature of the reaction is increased the system will favour the reaction direction which cools the system.
