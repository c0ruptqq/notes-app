title: Mesons
---

- Mu meson/Muon  - **Is not a meson** , It has the same properties to that of a electron but has 200 times the rest mass
- Pion - Can be $\pi^-, \pi^+, \pi^0$, greater mass than a muon but less than a proton
- Kaon - Can be $K^+,K^-,K^0$ is a **strange** particle

Mesons comprise from **2** fundamental particles called [[quarks]], specifically a quark antiquark pair.
- Pions are responsible for the strong nuclear force. Can be observed when colliding high energy protons and nuclei.
- Kaons exist for a long time and decay via the weak interaction to form pions.
