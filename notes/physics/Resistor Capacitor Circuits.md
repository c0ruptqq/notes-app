Position 1:
- Capacitor Charges
Position 2: 
- Capacitor Discharges
### Charging Capacitor 

Charge increases over time until the capacitor becomes fully charged

$Q = Q_{0}\left( 1-e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}} \right)$

$\tau \text{ (time constant}) \text{(s)}= R\times C$

#### When Charging
$\tau$ is the time required for the charge(A)/potential difference(V) across a capacitor to reach 63% of it maximum value. Since $V = \frac{Q}{C}$, $V \propto Q$. Current = rate of flow of charge = $\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$ = the gradient of a charge-time graph.

### Discharging Capacitors

#### When Discharging
$\tau$ is the time required for the charge(A)/potential difference(V) across a capacitor to decrease 36.8% of its initial value. 


### Half-life and time constant
