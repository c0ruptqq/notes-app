# Enthalpy Changes

## Standard Enthalpy change of atomisation
The enthalpy change which accompanies the formation of one mole of gaseous atoms from the elements in its standard state under standard conditions. ($\Delta_{at}H^{\theta}$), Eg.
$$\ce{Mg(s)-> Mg(g)}$$
$$\ce{\frac{1}{2}Br_{2}(l)->Br(g)}$$

## First Ionisation Energy
Standard enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms is converted into a mole of gaseous ions each with a single positive charge. ($\Delta_{i}H^{\theta}$)
$$\ce{Mg(g)->Mg(g)+ + e-}$$

## First electron affinity
The standard enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms is converted into a mole of gaseous ions each with a single negative charge. ($\Delta_{ea}H^{\theta}$)
$$\ce{O(g) +e- -> O(g)-}$$
For oxygen:
- First electron affinity is exothermic
- Second electron affinity is endothermic

## Lattice enthalpy of formation
The standard enthalpy change when one mole of solid ionic compound is formed from its gaseous ions. $\Delta_{L}H^{\theta}$

$$\ce{Na+(g) + Cl-(g) -> NaCl (s)}$$
$$\ce{Mg^{2+}(g) + 2Br- (g) -> MgBr_{2} (s)}$$

## Enthalpy of hydration
The standard enthalpy change when water molecules surround one more of gaseous ions. $\Delta_{hyd}H^{\theta}$
$$\ce{Na+ (g)-> Na+(aq)}$$
$$\ce{Cl- (g) -> Cl-(aq)}$$

## Enthalpy of solution
The standard enthalpy change when one mole of solute dissolves completely in sufficient solvent to form a solution in which the molecules or ions are far enough apart not to interact with each other. $\Delta_{sol}H^{\theta}$
$$\ce{NaCl(s)->Na+(aq) + Cl- (aq)}$$
$$\ce{MgO(s)-> Mg^{2+}(aq) +O^{2-} (aq)}$$
## Standard enthalpy of dissociation
Opposite of the lattice enthalpy of formation. 

$$\ce{NaCl(s)\to Na+ (g)+Cl-(g)}$$
## Haber-Cycle
