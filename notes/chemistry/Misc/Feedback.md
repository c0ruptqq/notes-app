## Energetics 2 Simonovic

20/32 - 62.5%
4 marks lost to definitions
5 marks lost on attention to details in calculations, mainly signs
- Learn definitions
	- Enthalpy change of formation
	- Enthalpy change of combustion
	- Average bond enthalpy
	- Energy CHANGE not energy REQUIRED
- Pay attention to significant figures
- Take stoichiometric numbers into consideration when comparing moles
- Changing the volumes in a neutralisation by a factor doesn't change the change in temperature
- Remember whether a reaction is endothermic or exothermic to double check its sign
- Pay attention to details in bond enthalpy questions:
	- Number of bonds in a diatomic molecules (1)
- When drawing an enthalpy change diagram the arrow has to go from line to line
**Explain in terms of bond breaking and bond making, why the enthalpy change of formation of NO is endothermic:**
- More energy is required for bond breaking than is released by bond making
**Explain why this equation represents the standard enthalpy change of combustion of butane:**
- One mole of butane **completely** combusts with oxygen

- Carbon is **solid** in room temperature

A reverse reaction's enthalpy is the same value with a different sign
