# 4 Projectile Motion
We model projectiles as particles, ignoring air resistance.
We consider their horizontal and their vertical motion separately. The only force acting on the particle is gravity so the horizontal acceleration is 0 and the vertical acceleration is –g. This means that we can use SUVAT to describe the vertical motion while using $\text{ speed } =\frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$ to model the horizontal motion. It is important to consider whether it is easier to consider the vertical or horizontal motion at the start of any given question.

## 4.1 Horizontal Projection

#### Example 4.1
A particle is projected horizontally at 20 $ms^{-1}$ from a point 65$m$ above the horizontal ground. Find the horizontal distance travelled by the particle before it hits the ground.

## 4.2 Projection at any angle
#### Example 4.2
A particle $P$ is projected from a point $2 m$ above a horizontal plane with an initial velocity of $40ms^{–1}$, with an angle of elevation of $20^{\circ}$.
1) the greatest height above the plane reached by P.
2) the horizontal distance travelled by P before it hits the ground.
