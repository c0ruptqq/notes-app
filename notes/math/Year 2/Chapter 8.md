# 8.1 Parametric Equations

## 8.1 Introduction

Curves can be described using parametric equations. A parametric graph is one in which x and y, instead of being directly linked in a Cartesian equation (like $y = x^2$) are instead both linked to another variable (called a parameter). For example, $y = t^2$, $x = 3t$ is a parametric graph going through (0, 0), (1, 3), (4, 6) etc (each value of t gives an (x, y) point). It is usually possible to find a Cartesian equation for a graph from its parametric equations by eliminating
the parameter.

#### Example 8.1
Find a Cartesian equation for the parametric curve $x=5t$, $y=3t^2$ $(0<t<20)$, stating its domain

#### Solution 8.1
$$x = 5t => t= \frac x 5$$

$$\begin {aligned} \therefore y &=3(\frac x 5)^2 \text{ for } 0< \frac x 5 < 20 \\ & = \frac {3x^2} {25} \text{ for } 0<x<100 \end{aligned}$$

For parametric equations involving trig functions, if you can't find a simple way to link x and y, use an appropriate trig identity.

#### Example 8.2
Find the Cartesian equation of the curve $x=\sin t + 2$, $y=\cos t -3$

#### Solution 8.2

$$x=\sin t => \sin t = x-2$$

$$y = \cos t -3 => \cos t =y+3$$

$$\therefore \cos^2 t\sin^2 t = 1 => (x-2)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 1$$


## 8.2 Working with Parametric Equations

#### Example 8.3

The diagram shows a curve C with parametric equations $x = at^2 + t$, $y = a(t^3 +8)$,  where $a$ is a non-zero constant. Given that C passes through the point (â€“4, 0),
a) find the value of a,
b) find the coordinates of the points A and B where the curve crosses the y-axis.
