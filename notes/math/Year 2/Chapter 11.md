# Integration
## 11.1 Linear transformation
If you can make an integral look like something you know by making a simple transformation then do so.

#### Example 11.1
Find $\int(2x+3)^4 dx$ 

#### Solution 11.1

$$\begin{aligned}\int(2x+3)^4 \\
\text{Let u } = 2x+3 => \frac {du} {dx} = 2 => dx = \frac {du} {2}\end{aligned}$$
