# 4 Projectile Motion

We model projectiles as particles, ignoring air resistance. We consider their horizontal and their vertical motion separately. The only force acting on the particle is gravity so the horizontal acceleration is 0 and the vertical acceleration is â€“g. This means that we can use SUVAT to describe the vertical motion while using $\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}}$ to model the horizontal motion. It is important to consider whether it is easier to consider the vertical or horizontal motion at the start of any
given question.
